Why isn't Square Enix remastering it along with the other titles for switch? - WhyNotPete00:36:50 - From following you on Twitter and listening to your appearances on the GI Show, it seems like you always have your ear to the ground when it comes to Nintendo leaks and rumors (MP4 & Trilogy HD's development, Mother 3's localization being canceled). I was wondering if you had any scoops for us ahead of today's Direct. - LearnedAstronomer00:41:12 - I have a prediction for what might show up in the Nintendo Direct later today: Spyro Reignited. That aside, I personally think it's high-time that we get a port of Super Mario 3D World and an enhanced port of Super Mario Maker with the campaign from the 3DS version. I could even see Nintendo making a special cable that runs from the Switch to the Dock so that the Switch can function like the Wii U.
