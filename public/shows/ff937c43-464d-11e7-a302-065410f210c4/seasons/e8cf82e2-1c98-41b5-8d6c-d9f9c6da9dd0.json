It’s time for another exciting round up of the biggest gaming news stories in the industry. Microsoft has been buying up all sorts of studios to work on exclusive titles and it sounds like they plan to acquire even more developers going forward. This news comes just after Microsoft confirmed the date for their Xbox Studios showcase coming July 23rd. While that’s all very exciting, it’s time to stop and really think about how much game executives are getting paid. Of course, Bobby Kotick’s salary has been under fire before, but now the CtW Investment Group is asking EA’s shareholders to vote against letting the publisher have total say in executive compensation. In a surprising twist, Capcom actually acknowledged that a majority of their sales are digital, which leaves us wondering about what the rest of the industry looks like. Lastly, and potentially the most exciting story for gamers everywhere: there’s a group at Valve who would like to make a full length Half-Life game and even bring it to consoles. Of course, what would a Weekend Roundup be without a 5-Second Review? This week Brian finds himself in an affair with Catherine: Full Body. \r\n\r\nCheck out our streaming schedule at http://twitter.com/InsideGaming\r\n\r\nListen to our podcast!\r\nhttps://link.chtbl.com/IGPodcast\r\n \r\nOr buy our shirt!\r\nhttps://is.gd/u3xCtA\r\n\r\nOR follow us on Twitter!\r\nhttp://twitter.com/briangaar\r\nhttps://twitter.com/mc_lotta\r\nhttp://twitter.com/InsideGaming\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\n[Games Industry dot biz] How Minecraft and Mojang taught Xbox how to buy studios https://bit.ly/3fi4e1p\r\n[The Information] Microsoft Expresses Interest in Acquiring Warner Game Unit https://bit.ly/2W5ux3c\r\n[Twitter] @Xbox https://bit.ly/3e8yBWM\r\n[Venture Beat] Xbox Games Showcase: What to expect from the July event https://bit.ly/3gI9V95\r\n[SEC]  Form PX14A6G Electronic Arts Inc.

Dr. Disrespect himself still claims he doesn’t know why he’s been banned but plans to continue forward with other career aspirations. Another unsolved game mystery has also recently been given a little more light. Ubisoft’s noticeably absent game Skull & Bones has reportedly been rebooted. There’s no release date yet, but fret not, there’s more good gaming news on the way. It looks like the Uncharted movie is really going to happen and Stadia is actually going to get some exclusives. Okay, we’ll take that last one how you will but you have to admit watching Brian do a 5-Second Review for Ghost of Tsushima is probably gonna be pretty fun.

However, games that were announced for the Xbox exclusively during the showcase have not been listed as being available on the Xbox One. OOoooooo SCANDAL!

Everyone constantly seems disappointed, and PlayStation’s August State of Play was no different - but this time there’s actually something worthy of a good rage. One of the games shown, Aeon Must Die!, brought attention to a major scandal between the games developer (Limestone Games) and their publisher (Focus Home Interactive). Don’t worry, it’s not all bad news! We’re also rounding up other highlights from the State of Play that don’t include theft and villainy. Well... Nintendo DID announce Pikmin 3 Deluxe and then immediately the original Pikmin 3 down from the eshop... so maybe this is a downer episode. We have got a new Dr. Disrespect sighting and it looks like he’s gonna be on YouTube for a while...maybe?? Who even knows anymore. Lastly, we're talking about why Apple has refused cloud gaming services to exist on the app store. Of course there’s a 5-Second Review of Carrion and THAT’S NOT ALL! Rocksteady Studios finally announced Suicide Squad. Anyways, Brian’s still on vacation but hopefully this substantially packed edition of the Weekend Roundup will keep you satiated while we all wait for his return. \r\n\r\nListen to our podcast!\r\nhttps://link.chtbl.com/IGPodcast\r\n \r\nOr buy our shirt!\r\nhttps://is.gd/u3xCtA\r\n\r\nOR follow us on Twitter!\r\nhttp://twitter.com/@DarthBurrit0\r\nhttps://twitter.com/HandsomeMaster2\r\nhttp://twitter.com/InsideGaming\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n[YoutTube] Playstation State of Play August 6th 2020\r\nhttps://youtu.be/lu8jivl_po4\r\n\r\n[YouTube] Aeon Must Die!

Now it seems some Cyberpunk 2077 devs are speaking up in their own defense.\r\n\r\nOf course all of this comes after a story from last week that CD Projekt Red publicly announced they would be going back on their previous statements against crunch and doubled down on crunching to finish Cyberpunk 2077 in time for its November release date.

Assuming there are at least a couple other groups like this out there in the world it’s pretty easy to see why it’s been so hard to pickup a new PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X.\r\n\r\nIn other news this week Sony is likely working on a new Game Pass like service, ex-Dragon Age director Mike Laidlaw is starting a new studio, there’s been a rise in controller use on steam, and a rare copy of Super Mario Bros. 3 is now the most expensive video game money can buy.\r\n\r\nOf course we have also got next week’s lineup of new releases and this week's 5-second review tackles Yakuza: Like a Dragon. \r\n\r\nListen to our podcast!\r\nhttps://link.chtbl.com/IGPodcast\r\n \r\nOr buy our shirt!\r\nhttps://is.gd/u3xCtA\r\n\r\nOR follow us on Twitter!\r\nhttps://twitter.com/briangaar\r\nhttps://twitter.com/KdinJenzen\r\nhttp://twitter.com/InsideGaming\r\n\r\nSOURCES \r\n\r\n[Business Insider] One reseller group snagged nearly 3,500 PlayStation 5 consoles, and the resale market might be the only place to score one after it sold out everywhere online https://bit.ly/3fwF9ks\r\n\r\n[GQ] PlayStation boss Jim Ryan wants the PS5 to be a seven-year success https://bit.ly/3nTtjUa\r\n[IGN] Former Dragon Age Director Announces New Studio https://bit.ly/3pURdR7\r\n[Steam] Steam Input API Adds PS5 Controller Support https://bit.ly/3l0TZRk\r\n[Eurogamer] Rare copy of Super Mario Bros. 3 breaks world record for most expensive video game https://bit.ly/3m34jt9","length":797,"original_air_date":"2020-11-28T16:30:00.000Z","channel_id":"8d8e8f0c-f58c-444e-bac4-1c33339bf105","channel_slug":"inside-gaming","season_id":"e8cf82e2-1c98-41b5-8d6c-d9f9c6da9dd0","season_slug":"inside-gaming-roundup-2020","season_number":5,"show_title":"Inside Gaming Roundup","show_id":"ff937c43-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","show_slug":"news-roundups","is_sponsors_only":false},"uuid":"3516235b-07f7-4837-b105-d6308e167aad","archive":{"id":"roosterteeth-41452","status":"archived","files":[{"name":"2020-11-28_PS5_scalping_has_gotten_out_of_control_[41452].description","filesize":1868,"file_ext":"description","md5":"f196934c38cc191a13c921651bf7abee"},{"name":"2020-11-28_PS5_scalping_has_gotten_out_of_control_[41452].info.json","filesize":21439,"file_ext":"json","md5":"c59c311481be0b850c91d7425fd21d82"},{"name":"2020-11-28_PS5_scalping_has_gotten_out_of_control_[41452].mp4","filesize":417017894,"file_ext":"mp4","md5":"f897e22f39371a2608ed79b1bf02d61b"},{"name":"2020-11-28_PS5_scalping_has_gotten_out_of_control_[41452].png","filesize":180599,"file_ext":"png","md5":"d94b0ce767beb67a3171bd7829e7dbab"}]}},{"id":41626,"type":"episode","attributes":{"title":"Wife forces Husband to sell his PS5","slug":"ig-roundup-12-05-20","number":46,"description":"Thanks to ExpressVPN for sponsoring our channel http://expressvpn.com/inside\r\n\r\nA tragic story about a man and his PS5 practically became an urban legend overnight as one husband tried to tell his wife that his newly purchased PS5 was actually just an air purifier.

Good Old Games, a subsidiary wholly owned by CD Projekt Red, recently pulled down a game called Devotion from their online store.\r\n\r\nThis was the Chinese made game that was previously featured in headlines before because it featured a Winnie the Pooh meme of the Chinese President, Xi Jinping and that caused a primarily chinese audience to review bomb the game in efforts to get it delisted.\r\n\r\nAlso as a result, the Chinese publisher of the game, Indievent, lost its business licence from the Chinese Government, supposedly due to the incident. The current assumption is that GoG or CDPR faced pressure from either an angry fanbase  or the Chinese government and removed the game from GoG.com.\r\n\r\nIf true, it’s a terrible look for CDPR who obviously has their own issues and for GoG who previously has had a reputation for being rebellious and gamer friendly. Saving face to save some sales when it comes to an artistic medium feels particularly scummy.\r\n\r\nIn addition to our headlining story today - were also covering Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s experience boosters, Among Us coming to Switch, an Interview with Nintendo’s Doug Bowser, and Henry Cavil hurt his leg while filming season two of The Witcher.\r\n\r\nThanks for watching the Inside Gaming Weekend Roundup!\r\n \r\nListen to our podcast!\r\nhttps://link.chtbl.com/IGPodcast\r\n \r\nOr buy our shirt!\r\nhttps://is.gd/u3xCtA\r\n\r\nOR follow us on Twitter!\r\nhttps://twitter.com/mc_lotta/\r\nhttps://twitter.com/briangaar\r\nhttp://twitter.com/InsideGaming\r\n\r\nSOURCES \r\n\r\n[VG 247] Devotion pulled from Steam following Xi Jinping Winnie the Pooh controversy https://bit.ly/3apu83y\r\n[VG 247] Censored horror game Devotion is getting a physical release, but not in the West https://bit.ly/37uFD7X\r\n[Twitter] @redcandlegames https://bit.ly/34qgOrW\r\n[Twitter] @GOGcom https://bit.ly/37vUpM3\r\n[Twitter] @MikeDrucker https://bit.ly/3h0San5\r\n[Game Informer] Assassin's Creed Valhalla Sells XP Boosts Now https://bit.ly/3rk5jwe\r\n[Nintendo] Among Us https://bit.ly/2KDPTSm\r\n[Polygon] Doug Bowser on Nintendo’s obsession with March 31, plus Joy-Con drift and the Switch Pro rumors https://bit.ly/3h1w8Au\r\n[The Sun] NETFLIX NIGHTMARE Henry Cavill throws The Witcher filming into chaos after hurting leg on assault course https://bit.ly/37xjy8W","length":641,"original_air_date":"2020-12-19T16:30:00.000Z","channel_id":"8d8e8f0c-f58c-444e-bac4-1c33339bf105","channel_slug":"inside-gaming","season_id":"e8cf82e2-1c98-41b5-8d6c-d9f9c6da9dd0","season_slug":"inside-gaming-roundup-2020","season_number":5,"show_title":"Inside Gaming Roundup","show_id":"ff937c43-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","show_slug":"news-roundups","is_sponsors_only":false},"uuid":"1e25e50e-2f9a-4793-ad67-90d7a8f66107","archive":{"id":"roosterteeth-41832","status":"archived","files":[{"name":"2020-12-19_CD_Projekt_Red__GoG_cave_to_Devotion_backlash_[41832].description","filesize":2449,"file_ext":"description","md5":"b29e4163233b7c5048bd28baa590ee07"},{"name":"2020-12-19_CD_Projekt_Red__GoG_cave_to_Devotion_backlash_[41832].info.json","filesize":22047,"file_ext":"json","md5":"e67d484e7029051d3723ac568e22fa7e"},{"name":"2020-12-19_CD_Projekt_Red__GoG_cave_to_Devotion_backlash_[41832].mp4","filesize":336501504,"file_ext":"mp4","md5":"8dbcfc314a2bb021665e092915f8d4e5"},{"name":"2020-12-19_CD_Projekt_Red__GoG_cave_to_Devotion_backlash_[41832].png","filesize":290281,"file_ext":"png","md5":"15bd12d649a10139850b2bfc4a059c97"}]}},{"id":41818,"type":"episode","attributes":{"title":"Every 5-Second Review in 2020","slug":"ig-roundup-01-02-21","number":49,"description":"Thanks to ExpressVPN for sponsoring our channel http://expressvpn.com/inside\r\n\r\nIt’s been an action-packed year of video game news and new releases - and we have covered it all right here on the Inside Gaming Roundup... but there is one part of the show that gets the least time to shine. \r\n\r\nThat’s not because it isn’t a good part of the show but because by it’s very nature it excels at being the shortest part of the show.

It was done the very last day we were in the office… So okay, yeah, yeah, the title of this video should be “Every 5-Second Review from 2020 (except the last one)” but no one wants to read all that.
