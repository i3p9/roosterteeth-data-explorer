It\u2019s time for the roundup!", "number": 1, "description": "Thanks to ExpressVPN for sponsoring our channel http://expressvpn.com/inside\r\n\r\nCyberpunk 2077 undeniably had a rough launch in mid-December across the PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Series S, and even the PC version took some hits so maybe it\u2019s not too surprising that the games player count is dwindling a little early.\r\n\r\nTo make a more apt comparison it\u2019s dwindling early compared to statistics gathered from the launch and ongoing player count of The Witcher 3. CD Projekt Red may yet launch another round of fixes and updates that bring players back but until then it looks like most players are waiting for the game to be fixed before they return to Night City.\r\n\r\nIn other news, it looks like Microsoft might be looking to add a few of the PlayStation 5\u2019s DualSense controller features to the next iteration of the newest Xbox controller. A survey went out asking Xbox customers what elements of Sony\u2019s newest hardware they thought they might want to be included in Xbox products. It doesn\u2019t mean anything yet but maybe we\u2019ll see better adaptive triggers come to the newest generation of Xbox controllers.\r\n\r\nIn another story reviewing and paying homage to the history of all things Xbox, a commercial encounter between Microsoft and Nintendo was revealed. Turns out, in the year 2000 Steve Balmer sent Microsoft execs to meet with Nintendo to see if the latter would be open to an acquisition. We all know how history played out but safe to say there was more than a bit of laughter.\r\n\r\nAs for Nintendo acquisitions, the house that Mario built is buying the company that built Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3. Okay that didn\u2019t work really but you see it\u2026 you see it. The purchase of Next Level games, makers of Mario Super Strikers, Metroid Prime Fedration Force, and Punchout on the Wii, will be made final in March.\r\n\r\nIndustry analysts are predicting that the Nintendo Switch will out sell next-gen consoles in the new year and lastly, something maybe no one could have predicted, Star Citizen had another record breaking year of fundraising.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a story packed week as the new year launches itself toward the future but stick around for a 5-Second Review of Super Meat Boy Forever and a brief yet pleasant \u201ccoming soon\u201d section. \r\n\r\nOr buy our shirt!\r\nhttps://is.gd/u3xCtA\r\n\r\nOR follow us on Twitter!\r\nhttps://twitter.com/briangaar\r\nhttps://twitter.com/snackary_\r\nhttps://twitter.com/DarthBurrit0\r\nhttp://twitter.com/InsideGaming\r\n\r\nSOURCES \r\n\r\n[SteamDB] Cyberpunk 2077 https://bit.ly/3pZx0c9\r\n[GitHyp] Cyberpunk 2077's Player Base Has Declined 3x Faster Than The Witcher 3\u2019s Launch on Steam https://bit.ly/3s3y8x4\r\n[Steam Charts] The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt https://bit.ly/3s1w5tr\r\n[CD Projekt Red] Current report no. 68/2020 https://bit.ly/3s4NEZS\r\n[VG 247] Cyberpunk 2077 has sold over 13 million copies despite refunds and launch disaster https://bit.ly/3nopoyb\r\n[TechRadar] Xbox Series X survey asks if you want PS5 DualSense features in the Xbox controller https://bit.ly/3bgzPRR\r\n[Bloomberg] Xbox: The Oral History of an American Video Game Empire https://bloom.bg/3noa1WC\r\n[VG 247] Nintendo is buying Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 studio Next Level Games https://bit.ly/3otcRei\r\n[Games Industry dot biz] Where do we go from here?

After ten years of EA exclusive Star Wars games, Disney is finally going to let other studios and publishers take a crack at making their own takes on a galaxy far, far away. A new team-up with Ubisoft will have Divison 2 developer Massive working on an open-world game set in the Star Wars universe. Few details are known at this point but this is exciting news for Star Wars fans everywhere. Especially those waiting for a new Knights of the Old Republic game.\r\n\r\nDisney isn\u2019t just stopping at Star Wars though. A new partnership was announced with Bethesda who will be working on a new Indiana Jones game. Indie\u2019s next adventure will be crafted by Wolfenstein II: New Colossus developers Machine Games.\r\n\r\nIn other news, CD Projekt Red has released an apology video for the launch of Cyberpunk 2077 and they included a roadmap for patches and updates that will be coming to the game over the course of the year. Poland\u2019s consumer protection bureau has released a statement saying if CDPR fails to deliver, the company will be fined 10% of its revenue for the entire year.\r\n\r\nLastly, Riot and Bungie are teaming to up sue a company that is making a profit from selling hacks and cheats for Destiny and Valorant.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a weekend roundup without a 5-second review and today Brian\u2019s tackling...

They even commented about how easy it was.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a Mortal Kombat pro was banned from a tournament for taking a small jab at NetherRealm Studios. TitaniumTigerzz changed their Sheeva variant name to \u201cWhyDidNRSdothis?\u201d mid finals during the Mortal Kombat Pro Kompetition: North American League - NA West Week 2 indicating some of Sheeva\u2019s kit is overpowered and easy to use.

Valve alone is looking at a $2 million dollar fine.\r\n\r\nAnother Bloomberg report has come out detailing working conditions leading up to the launch of Cyberpunk 2077 and includes internal testimonies about the mindset around the game.

While video games are incredibly expensive to make the plan does seem a little backwards considering exclusives are a proven way to bring new players to your gaming ecosystem.\r\n\r\nA Nintendo financial brief revealed that we likely aren\u2019t getting a new version of the Switch anytime soon. It\u2019s a little disappointing to hear since there have been plenty of rumors claiming otherwise but considering how well the Switch is selling now - it makes sense Nintendo would hold out for as long as possible.\r\n\r\nThis week\u2019s most surprising news has to be Embracer\u2019s purchase of Gearbox Software for $363 million dollars. Embracer also owns THQ Nordiq, Koch Media, and Saber Interactive. All five-hundred and fifty employees will remain employed and Randy Pitchford will maintain a leadership role within the company.\r\n\r\nLastly, EA Sports is making a new College Football game and the broader company will be bringing a remastered version of the Mass Effect trilogy to market May 14th.\r\n\r\nStick around for a casual coming soon section and this weeks 5-second review of Destruction All-Stars.

The company was breached the source code for Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3, and Gwent was stolen. The company acknowledged the cyber attack earlier this week and shared the ransom note that the hackers left behind. To make matters worse it appears the hackers have already posted an auction for the source code for Gwent. CDPR has said they do not plan to negotiate with the attackers and it doesn\u2019t like any employee or player data was stolen.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of more bad news, Ubisoft claimed in an earnings report that they are moving away from AAA games to focus more on mobile titles.

In a blog posted earlier this week, Bioware officially announced that the project referred to as Anthem Next helmed by thirty people in an attempt to reboot Anthem will be no more. Instead, the company seeks to reallocate its workforce and resources towards other Bioware projects like the next Dragon Age, the newly announced Mass Effect collection, and maintaining their Star Wars MMO.\r\n\r\nWe recently talked about how CD Projekt Red was hacked and exhorted but now it seems like the security breach is causing issues elsewhere in the company. The previously scheduled 1.2 patch for Cyberpunk 2077 that contains a variety of improvements and fixes for the game will now be delayed. In a tweet, CDPR explained that this was due to a combination of the hack and the scope of the patch.\r\n\r\nIn other news, a Gamestop executive just resigned and Fry\u2019s Electronics is going out of business shutting down stores across the nation.\r\n\r\nStick around for a fun roundup of all the games coming out next week and 5-Second Review of Bravely Default II.\r\n\r\nWatch more roundup!\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4L4joG3Ycs&list=PLdBe6gw9Ydok7DM7HaEyPBnRSM5K0hWA5\r\n \r\nBuy our shirt!\r\nhttps://is.gd/u3xCtA\r\n\r\nOR follow us on Twitter!\r\nhttps://twitter.com/briangaar\r\nhttps://twitter.com/DarthBurrit0\r\nhttp://twitter.com/InsideGaming\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n[Bioware] Anthem Final Update\r\nhttps://blog.bioware.com/2021/02/24/anthem-update/\r\n\r\n[Bloomberg] EA decides the fate of Anthem\r\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/electronic-arts-to-decide-fate-of-anthem-game-this-week?sref=P6Q0mxvj\r\n\r\n[Twitter] CDPR on Cyberpunk 2077 1.2 Patch\r\nhttps://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1364607741680115717?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1364607741680115717%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F2021%2F2%2F24%2F22299188%2Fcyberpunk-2077-patch-1-2-delayed-march-2021\r\n\r\n[IGN] Gamestop Exec resigns\r\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/gamestop-cfo-jim-bell-resigns\r\n\r\n[New York Times] Fry\u2019s Electronics will cease operations\r\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/business/frys-electronics-a-favorite-of-tech-enthusiasts-will-cease-operations.html\r\n\r\n[Frys] Official Fry\u2019s Statement\r\nhttps://www.frys.com/", "display_title": "Bioware kills Anthem reboot", "length": 628, "advert_config": "", "advertising": true, "ad_timestamps": "314.00", "public_golive_at": "2021-02-27T16:30:00.000Z", "sponsor_golive_at": "2021-02-26T20:15:00.000Z", "member_golive_at": "2021-02-27T16:30:00.000Z", "original_air_date": "2021-02-26T20:15:00.000Z", "channel_id": "8d8e8f0c-f58c-444e-bac4-1c33339bf105", "channel_slug": "inside-gaming", "season_id": "486d84b5-b298-4116-8ee7-8dc232bebebb", "season_slug": "inside-gaming-roundup-2021", "season_number": 6, "show_title": "Inside Gaming Roundup", "show_id": "ff937c43-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4", "show_slug": "news-roundups", "is_sponsors_only": false, "member_tier_i": -1, "sort_number": 60008, "genres": ["Gaming"], "is_live": true, "is_schedulable": true, "season_order": "desc", "episode_order": "desc", "downloadable": true, "blacklisted_countries": [], "upsell_next": false, "trending_score": 1.0, "time_boost": 21.02262015, "credits_start_at": null, "trending_carousel": false}, "uuid": "8c337673-a693-44eb-8652-49a9c5b74911", "canonical_links": {"self": "/watch/ig-roundup-02-26-21", "show": "/series/news-roundups"}, "archive": {"id": "roosterteeth-42614", "status": "archived", "files": [{"name": "2021-02-26_Bioware_kills_Anthem_reboot_[42614].description", "filesize": 2476, "file_ext": "description", "md5": "1d6a9be144bc6cbf33d0b430a7e5e658"}, {"name": "2021-02-26_Bioware_kills_Anthem_reboot_[42614].info.json", "filesize": 22024, "file_ext": "json", "md5": "ebf3b94626dee889ef30eea8639b7743"}, {"name": "2021-02-26_Bioware_kills_Anthem_reboot_[42614].mp4", "filesize": 329584881, "file_ext": "mp4", "md5": "fdafa52dac67ffeebaa48c37fb87a696"}, {"name": "2021-02-26_Bioware_kills_Anthem_reboot_[42614].png", "filesize": 231901, "file_ext": "png", "md5": "c999d3b191814dfddcddc8b7f84a7396"}]}}, {"id": 42730, "type": "episode", "attributes": {"title": "Report: Switch Pro coming this year", "slug": "ig-roundup-03-05-21", "rating": null, "caption": "The Switch Pro might be out in time for the holidays, Epic Games is buying the makers of Fall Guys, Google might have canceled a Hideo Kojima horror game, Valheim is still good, and Sony just filed a patent to make PS5 controllers out of\u2026 bananas?", "number": 9, "description": "Go to http://pittstopcoffee.com/discount/INSIDE or use code INSIDE at checkout for 15% off your first order and subscribe for 10% off every order!\r\n\r\nThanks to ExpressVPN for sponsoring our channel http://expressvpn.com/inside\r\n\r\nThe long-rumored Switch Pro is coming out this year according to a report Bloomberg made earlier this week.

She was previously known for her work developing franchises like Assasins Creed and Watchdogs while at Ubisoft and then moving onto EA to build Motive. It was certainly a loss for Google, but now Raymond is teaming up with Sony to build a new game studio called Haven Entertainment.\r\n\r\nAfter the news, stick around for a 5-Second Review of Loop Hero and a Coming Soon section that doesn\u2019t quit.

Blizzard specifically has lost almost 30% of its active player base which is about 11 million players.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a stark revelation compared to the golden days of \u201cBlizzard polish\u201d where games would take a long time to make but they would bangers. Now, there aren't a lot of games, and the last one they released, WarCraft III Reforged, was a hot mess. Anyways we\u2019re diving into it today and there\u2019s a lot leading up to this moment.\r\n\r\nIn other news, the Epic Games v. Apple Inc. court case continues to be a faucet of news and information about the inner workings of the video game industry in a way we haven\u2019t seen before. For example, it was recently revealed during the court proceedings that Sony actually charges publishers a cross-play fee in order for them to enable the feature.\r\n\r\nBoth Stadia and CD Projekt Red have lost lead developers and in a bombshell announcement that shook the realm of games media, Giant Bomb recently announced they would be saying goodbye to Brad Shoemaker, Vinny Caravella, and Alex Navarro. \r\n\r\nWe wish all those duders the very best on whatever's next as we here at Inside Gaming are no strangers to a lineup change.\r\n\r\nThe Mass Effect Trilogy Remaster is almost upon us and a couple of others titles you might want to check out in the coming soon section and this week\u2019s 5-Second Review of Resident Evil Village has Brian reliving some of the scariest moments of his life.\r\n\r\nThanks for watching and have an awesome weekend. \r\n\r\nWatch more roundup!\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4L4joG3Ycs&list=PLdBe6gw9Ydok7DM7HaEyPBnRSM5K0hWA5\r\n \r\nBuy our

and modern washing machines have in common? They all use semiconductors and if you haven\u2019t heard there is a big shortage affecting everything from consumer electronics to house hold appliances and even automobiles.\r\n\r\nSony, Microsoft, and Nintendo are exception and the shortage is putting a strain on the supply of new consoles each manufacturer is able to produce. Sony issued a statement this morning saying they are ramping up production over the summer but will it be enough for people to finally just walk into a store or go online and buy a PS5?\r\n\r\nIn other news Skull & Bones has been delayed once again making it the third\u2026 or fourth time the fairly anticipated nautical combat game has been pushed into dangerous waters.\r\n\r\nUbisoft is planning to put more resources into a higher tier for free-to-play and mobile games which maybe isn\u2019t a surprise but we won\u2019t blame you if you want to clutch onto a boxed copy of Assassin\u2019s Creed or something.\r\n \r\nA new blog post from The Coalition makers of God of War alluded to the studio working on multiple projects in the coming years which has some speculating about a potential new IP or remake.\r\n\r\nLastly, Gabe Newell did an interview panel at a college in New Zealand and was asked if any Steam games would be coming to console. His answer was cryptic but got a lot of people excited. \r\n\r\nTo round things out stick around for a 5-Second Review of Returnal and Coming Soon section that doesn\u2019t quit.\r\n\r\nThanks for watching everyone and have a great weekend.  \r\n\r\nWatch more roundup!\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4L4joG3Ycs&list=PLdBe6gw9Ydok7DM7HaEyPBnRSM5K0hWA5\r\n \r\nBuy our shirt!\r\nhttps://is.gd/u3xCtA\r\n\r\nOR follow us on Twitter!\r\nhttps://twitter.com/briangaar\r\nhttps://twitter.com/DarthBurrit0\r\nhttp://twitter.com/InsideGaming", "display_title": "PlayStation 5 shortages are here to stay", "length": 624, "advert_config": "", "advertising": true, "ad_timestamps": "312.00", "public_golive_at": "2021-05-15T16:30:00.000Z", "sponsor_golive_at": "2021-05-15T01:05:00.000Z", "member_golive_at": "2021-05-15T16:30:00.000Z", "original_air_date": "2021-05-15T01:05:00.000Z", "channel_id": "8d8e8f0c-f58c-444e-bac4-1c33339bf105", "channel_slug": "inside-gaming", "season_id": "486d84b5-b298-4116-8ee7-8dc232bebebb", "season_slug": "inside-gaming-roundup-2021", "season_number": 6, "show_title": "Inside Gaming Roundup", "show_id": "ff937c43-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4", "show_slug": "news-roundups", "is_sponsors_only": false, "member_tier_i": -1, "sort_number": 60019, "genres": ["Gaming"], "is_live": true, "is_schedulable": true, "season_order": "desc", "episode_order": "desc", "downloadable": true, "blacklisted_countries": [], "upsell_next": false, "trending_score": 1.0, "time_boost": 21.05150105, "credits_start_at": null, "trending_carousel": false}, "uuid": "a1e47773-e724-4887-abdd-4cccc6a70ac3", "canonical_links": {"self": "/watch/ig-roundup-05-14-21", "show": "/series/news-roundups"}, "archive": {"id": "roosterteeth-43732", "status": "archived", "files": [{"name": "2021-05-15_PlayStation_5_shortages_are_here_to_stay_[43732].description", "filesize": 2012, "file_ext": "description", "md5": "90bde6af8f4383ebebb62eb6c147caba"}, {"name": "2021-05-15_PlayStation_5_shortages_are_here_to_stay_[43732].info.json", "filesize": 21591, "file_ext": "json", "md5": "68c435caf12df91039ede970b911d09a"}, {"name": "2021-05-15_PlayStation_5_shortages_are_here_to_stay_[43732].mp4", "filesize": 328113523, "file_ext": "mp4", "md5": "340bdacaebc56dd80909f9338de5ad23"}, {"name": "2021-05-15_PlayStation_5_shortages_are_here_to_stay_[43732].png", "filesize": 244218, "file_ext": "png", "md5": "fed81ed563ae2001017ef376e01062bf"}]}}, {"id": 43822, "type": "episode", "attributes": {"title": "IGN staff at war with publisher", "slug": "ig-roundup-05-21-21", "rating": null, "caption": "The IGN staff is at war with its publisher, WB Games could get broken up, Cyberpunk 2077 is in more legal trouble, Call of Duty has banned more than 500k players, there\u2019s a new TimeSplitters game in the works, and Twitch cracks down on hot tub streamers.", "number": 20, "description": "Go to http://expressvpn.com/roundup to get an extra 3 months of ExpressVPN FREE with a 1-year package.\r\n\r\nIGN and it\u2019s owners Ziff Daivs and J2 Global are at ends this week as the later committed a corporate overreach to censor a blog IGN posted in support of those suffering in Palestine.\r\n\r\nThe blog post went up on IGN last Friday and listed a number of charities like, Doctors Without Borders, as a means to aid those impacted by the increased military aggression and bombings from the Israli military.  \r\n\r\nThe post vanished over the weekend and now a large number of IGN staffers have organized and signed an open letter to their owners and parent companies asking for answers.

Declare a winner!\r\n\r\nWho won E3 2021? Well we\u2019re running through all the announcements and aftermath to help you decide for yourself. Admittedly E3 was a little weird this year but we still got a lot of great game announcements.\r\n\r\nHalo Infinite, Forza Horizon 5, Starfield, Red Fall all showed up as champions of the Xbox while Nintendo brought a trailer for the sequel to Breath of the Wild, a New WarioWare game, a remake of Advance Wars 1 + 2, and an entirely new entry into the Metroid series with Metroid Dread.\r\n\r\nOf course everything within a week radius of E3 is being referred to as E3 proper but it was the Summer Game Fest that actually brought the goods with Elden Ring which had a very strong trailer.\r\n\r\nThere was also a ton of Indie Games and a number showcases not tied directly to E# proper that had some interesting announcements as well.\r\n\r\nIn other news Cyberpunk is finally being allowed back onto the PlayStation Store, Everwild is being rebooted, Pokemon Unite is releasing soon, and GTA Online is shutting down on the PS3 and Xbox 360.\r\n\r\nThis week\u2019s 5-Second

still has some pretty serious issues. CD Projekt Red themselves recommend playing on an upgraded PS4 Pro or Xbox Series X and reminded all the potential PS4 buyers that they will get a free next gen upgrade.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that Cyberpunk came out when it did and in the state it did but hopefully CD Projekt Red continues to improve all versions of the game and it\u2019s a lesson for the entire industry going forward. \r\n\r\nIn other news Phil Spencer spoke casually about Halo Infinite and bringing back Killer Instinct on the Dropped Frames podcast. A data miner might have discovered an early alpha for Dragon Age 4, Nintendo poured some cold water on the recent Switch Pro rumors, and Marvel\u2019s Avengers has a very bad bug.\r\n\r\nThis week\u2019s 5-Second Review makes the entirety of a very boring sport palatable and the Coming Soon section has a couple weird ones.\r\n\r\nThanks for tuning in and have a great weekend! \r\n\r\nWatch more roundup!\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4L4joG3Ycs&list=PLdBe6gw9Ydok7DM7HaEyPBnRSM5K0hWA5\r\n \r\nBuy our shirt!\r\nhttps://is.gd/u3xCtA\r\n\r\nOR follow us on Twitter!\r\nhttps://twitter.com/briangaar\r\nhttps://twitter.com/DarthBurrit0\r\nhttp://twitter.com/InsideGaming\r\n\r\nSOURCES \r\n\r\n[Twitter] Official Cyberpunk 2077 PlayStation Store marketing omits PS4 https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1406924590555799556\r\n\r\n[Twitter] Official Cyberpunk 2077 warns players \r\nhttps://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1406924592900366336\r\n\r\n[YouTube] Cyberpunk 2077 Patch 1.23: PS4/Pro vs PS5 -

Well, in a recent interview with Bethesda creative director Todd Howard, it was revealed that Elder Scrolls VI is still in the design phase.\r\n\r\nThe next Elder Scrolls entry was officially announced three years ago so it\u2019s a little surprising to hear that so little progress has been made. Game development isn\u2019t easy and apparently neither is managing expectations for one of the medium's most coveted franchises.\r\n\r\nIn other news, Phil Spencer was on IGN\u2019s 500th Podcast Unlocked episode where he dropped some hot knowledge about game pass and the anticipated Halo Infinite. Essentially he said no matter how Infinite performs, Halo isn\u2019t going anywhere. \r\n\r\nWe\u2019re used to hearing acquisition news from Microsoft but this time it\u2019s Sony\u2019s turn. Housemarque, the developers behind Resogun, Super Stardust HD, and Returnal will be joining the PlayStation family.\r\n\r\nCyberpunk 2077 is back in the news as CD Projekt Red\u2019s CEO has officially said Cyberpunk has reached a \u201csatisfying level.\u201d\r\n\r\nLastly, if you\u2019re hoping for more mini consoles like the NES and SNES Classic models there\u2019s a small chance it could happen. In a shareholders meeting Nintendo\u2019s president said they aren\u2019t ruling out the possibility.\r\n\r\nThis weeks 5-Second Review takes a turn as Brian tries to explain Disgaea 6 and the Coming Soon section has both an overlooked gem and a new Monster Hunter game.\r\n\r\nWatch more roundup!\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4L4joG3Ycs&list=PLdBe6gw9Ydok7DM7HaEyPBnRSM5K0hWA5\r\n \r\nBuy our shirt!\r\nhttps://is.gd/u3xCtA\r\n\r\nOR follow us on Twitter!\r\nhttps://twitter.com/briangaar\r\nhttps://twitter.com/DarthBurrit0\r\nhttp://twitter.com/InsideGaming\r\n\r\nSOURCES \r\n\r\n[YouTube] Elder Scrolls VI official trailer\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkFdqqyI8y4&ab_channel=BethesdaSoftworks\r\n\r\n[Telegraph] Todd Howard Interview\r\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/news/first-pitched-game-lucas-2009-todd-howard-talks-indiana-jones/\r\n\r\n[VGC] Elder Scrolls VI expectations\r\nhttps://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/its-good-to-think-of-elder-scrolls-6-as-still-in-a-design-phase-says-todd-howard/amp/?__twitter_impression=true\r\n\r\n[YouTube] Phil Spencer on Podcast Unlocked 500\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG84Sxjdy1Q&ab_channel=IGNGames\r\n\r\n[Game Informer] Phil Spencer Interview summary\r\nhttps://www.gameinformer.com/2021/06/30/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-says-halo-infinite-is-not-make-or-break-for-the-ip\r\n\r\n[PlayStation Blog] Sony buys Housemarque\r\nhttps://blog.playstation.com/2021/06/29/welcoming-housemarque-to-the-playstation-studios-family/\r\n\r\n[VGC] Cyberpunk 2077 is fine according to CDPR\r\nhttps://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cd-projekt-says-cyberpunk-2077s-performance-has-reached-a-satisfying-level/\r\n\r\n[VGC] Nintendo still considering mini consoles\r\nhttps://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-says-its-still-considering-possible-new-mini-consoles/", "display_title": "Elder Scrolls VI still in \u201cdesign phase\u201d after 3 years", "length": 558, "advert_config": "", "advertising": true, "ad_timestamps": "279.00", "public_golive_at": "2021-07-03T16:30:00.000Z", "sponsor_golive_at": "2021-07-03T02:00:00.000Z", "member_golive_at": "2021-07-03T16:30:00.000Z", "original_air_date": "2021-07-03T02:00:00.000Z", "channel_id": "8d8e8f0c-f58c-444e-bac4-1c33339bf105", "channel_slug": "inside-gaming", "season_id": "486d84b5-b298-4116-8ee7-8dc232bebebb", "season_slug": "inside-gaming-roundup-2021", "season_number": 6, "show_title": "Inside Gaming Roundup", "show_id": "ff937c43-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4", "show_slug": "news-roundups", "is_sponsors_only": false, "member_tier_i": -1, "sort_number": 60026, "genres": ["Gaming"], "is_live": true, "is_schedulable": true, "season_order": "desc", "episode_order": "desc", "downloadable": true, "blacklisted_countries": [], "upsell_next": false, "trending_score": 1.0, "time_boost": 21.070302, "credits_start_at": null, "trending_carousel": false}, "uuid": "0b0bf286-fe9c-4e87-84c3-86c66c34f39e", "canonical_links": {"self": "/watch/ig-roundup-07-02-21", "show": "/series/news-roundups"}, "archive": {"id": "roosterteeth-44363", "status": "archived", "files": [{"name": "2021-07-03_Elder_Scrolls_VI_still_in_design_phase_after_3_years_[44363].description", "filesize": 3151, "file_ext": "description", "md5": "eada26e4c3652569afd3b3d4787f6e81"}, {"name": "2021-07-03_Elder_Scrolls_VI_still_in_design_phase_after_3_years_[44363].info.json", "filesize": 22831, "file_ext": "json", "md5": "f74e9866c9906588f74a2b2f2b8a6208"}, {"name": "2021-07-03_Elder_Scrolls_VI_still_in_design_phase_after_3_years_[44363].mp4", "filesize": 292586725, "file_ext": "mp4", "md5": "0f6dd316ab968207ca8dc09ef833ec17"}, {"name": "2021-07-03_Elder_Scrolls_VI_still_in_design_phase_after_3_years_[44363].png", "filesize": 236967, "file_ext": "png", "md5": "cf7ebe7808944bb32985bb2a1c52def7"}]}}, {"id": 44414, "type": "episode", "attributes": {"title": "PlayStation Showcase Recap and New Switch Pro Rumors", "slug": "ig-roundup-07-09-21", "rating": null, "caption": "PlayStation\u2019s July State of Play was alright, there are still a ton of Switch Pro rumors, Ubisoft\u2019s next Assassin\u2019s Creed is a live service game, Dice LA is now called Ripple Effect Studios, and Tencent really doesn\u2019t want kids late night gaming.", "number": 27, "description": "Go to http://hellofresh.com/14roundup and use code 14roundup for up to 14 free meals plus free shipping!\r\n\r\nThanks to ExpressVPN for sponsoring our channel http://expressvpn.com/inside\r\n\r\nBrian\u2019s out on vacation for the next two weeks so Evan is subbing in.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s no secret E3 2021 was a little busted but even still both Nintendo and Microsoft managed to pull through with strong summer showcases which has left PlayStation fans waiting for a big event of their own.\r\n\r\nWell, July\u2019s State of Play event didn\u2019t quite hit the mark but to Sony\u2019s credit they gave fair warning around what the small showcase would entail. However, summer is coming to an end and so rumors are ramping up about a special PlayStation event that could happen in August.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Rumors the Switch Pro continues to be a hot button topic even after the OLED Switch was officially confirmed this week. Some have even now resorted to calling the next, next iteration of Nintendo\u2019s hybrid console the Switch 2.\r\n\r\nIn other news Ubisoft is preparing to turn the Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise into a platform or game as service, DICE LA is being rebranded to Ripple Effect Studios, and Tencent really doesn\u2019t want kids in China staying up past their bedtime to play video games.\r\n\r\nIn

Pok\u00e9mon Unite is The Pok\u00e9mon Company\u2019s foray into the MOBA genre with the entire Pok\u00e9mon roster at their disposal. On paper, combining a very popular gaming genre with some of the most recognizable characters in the biz seems like a recipe for success\u2026 but maybe  too much so.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out Pok\u00e9mon Unite is riddled with questionable microtransactions and systems that are predatory when it comes to free-play games and even includes elements of pay-to-win progression systems. Hold onto your wallets because we have all the details in today\u2019s roundup.\r\n\r\nIn other news, Final Fantasy XIV Online is really blowing up causing all kinds of server related issues, Nintendo officially said there is no new Switch planned at this time, and Skull & Bones finally hit alpha.

gone from pretty bad to even worse at Activision Blizzard as a 2-year investigation conducted by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing has unearthed copious amounts of information about the companies toxic work culture, serious claims of sexual harassment, and just an overflow of gender discrimination.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a long week which included a terrible corporate response to lawsuit from Activision Blizzard top brass, open letters from the larger staff, walkouts, viral videos, and horrendous findings about those involved with something called \u201cThe Cosby Suite.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe did our best to recap all the developing stories related to the #ActiBlizzwalkout here so it\u2019s a good place to catch if you hadn\u2019t heard about everything going on or the details involved. Be warned though some of this is pretty dark so we prefaced this weeks episode with a CONTENT WARNING for sexual assault, harrasment, and suicide.\r\n\r\nIn other news this week video games and video game hardware are selling very well. PlayStation 5 is the fastest selling Sony console and the Xbox Series S and X are setting records in that regard for Microsoft as well.\r\n\r\nShawn Layden fired some shots this week when talking about Game Pass saying consolidation is the enemy of diversity and the amount of subscribers needed to support one triple game was around 500 million.\r\n\r\nLastly, Death Stranding has sold 5 million copies and Kojima productions expects to sell even more when the new directors cut drops later this year in September.\r\n\r\nWe return to Zelda Skyward Sword HD for Brian\u2019s official take and the Coming Soon section has a fascinating multiplayer FPS game about time loops called Lemnis Gate.\r\n\r\nCheck it out and thanks for watching!\r\n\r\nWatch more

working conditions calling out Activision Blizzard on union busting tactics and sharing even more distressing stories and testimonies about the harassment their co-workers have faced there.\r\n\r\n* A quick content warning for descriptions of sex assualt and harrasment as well as a mention of suicde.\r\n\r\nThings aren\u2019t looking good as more and more stories come out from Blizzard employees. From hidden bathroom cameras to breastfeeding room creepers it seems like there is no end to the attributes and toxic work conditions workers at Blizzard put up with.\r\n\r\nThere was even a new story that came out from Bloomberg detailing a number of new accounts including an exec making a joke in poor taste about sleeping with assistants.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a lot. In other news Ubisoft employees are also trying to fight the good fight against executive or leadership level employees who allegedly have not only gotten away with harassment or abuse but have even been given promotions after the fact.\r\n\r\nOn the lighter side of things it looks like it might get easier to pick up a PS5. Sony has confirmed that  the semiconductor shortage is no longer an issue for them when it comes to meeting their sales targets for the PS5 this fiscal year.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it looks like PSVR2 is shaping up to be pretty cool. A number of details were shared a developer conference and they were picked up by the press. Fancy new controllers on cable without a pass through and maybe even VR options for all the biggest Sony exclusives.\r\n\r\nLastly, Amazon\u2019s MMO New Worlds was delayed until September 28th. Brian conquers his fear and returns to Death\u2019s Door for a second 5-Second Review of the game. The Coming Soon section comes packing some heat this week with Glitchpunk and Hades on consoles.\r\n\r\nWatch more roundup!\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4L4joG3Ycs&list=PLdBe6gw9Ydok7DM7HaEyPBnRSM5K0hWA5\r\n \r\nBuy our shirt!\r\nhttps://is.gd/u3xCtA\r\n\r\nOR follow us on Twitter!\r\nhttps://twitter.com/briangaar\r\nhttps://twitter.com/DarthBurrit0\r\nhttp://twitter.com/InsideGaming\r\n\r\nSOURCES \r\n\r\n[IGN] Blizzard sued by the state of California\r\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california\r\n\r\n[IGN] Blizzard recap\r\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/inside-activision-blizzards-week-of-reckoning\r\n\r\n[Waypoint] Blizzard IT installed hidden bathroom cameras\r\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/7kvm8g/activision-it-worker-secretly-filmed-colleagues-in-office-bathroom\r\n\r\n[Waypoint] Blizzard IT make rude comments to career fair attendee\r\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/3aq4vv/blizzard-recruiters-asked-hacker-if-she-liked-being-penetrated-at-job-fair\r\n\r\n[Blizzard] Blizzard gets two new presidents\r\nhttps://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23706475/new-leadership-at-blizzard\r\n\r\n[VG247] Brack and Morhaime respond to allegations \r\nhttps://www.vg247.com/2021/07/24/activision-blizzard-harassment-lawsuit-mike-morhaime-j-allen-brack/\r\n\r\n[VG247] Blizzard President J.

are being delayed, and previously confirmed features are being cut.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse shareholders have sued Activision Blizzard for overwhelming negligence at best and intentionally providing misleading information when it comes to the working conditions at the company.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile another shareholder group has called out Activision Blizzard\u2019s response to the state of California's lawsuit as \u201cinadequate.\u201d Specifically, Bobby Kotick was mentioned and there\u2019s been a number of suggestions from the group including removing executive level bonuses.\r\n\r\nIt really is bad news for everyone involved at this point as the fallout over Blizzard\u2019s highly toxic working conditions continues to spiral into a series of consequences.\r\n\r\nIn other news; the new Call of Duty game CoD: Vanguard has leaked via an update to Call of Duty: Warzone, it looks like there are three Grand Theft Auto remasters in the works (including GTAIII, GTA: Vice City, and GTA: San Andreas), there\u2019s a new South Park game in the works, and Google considered buying Epic to make their legal complaints just go away.\r\n\r\nThis

years ago in what was probably one of the most contentious and controversial launches in the last decade. Fans were completely disappointed with the lack of things to do in an infinite world in addition to a lack of features at launched that were promised in vague marketing terms over the course of two years leading up to the games release. \r\n\r\nHello Games went completely radio silent for months as they began their long arduous journey of patching and updating the game. Five years later Hello Games is still adding tons of improvements and updates to the game and entirely for free.\r\n\r\nHowever it didn\u2019t take them that long to fix the game enough for people to start coming back around. Today\u2019s video is in part a celebration of Hello Games\u2019 dedication and endurance that ultimately allowed them to pull off one of the biggest comebacks in gaming history.\r\n\r\nNo Man\u2019s Sky Frontiers, which is the game's newest update that allows players to build up small space towns populated with aliens, just got a new trailer and will be out this year.\r\n\r\nIn other news teardown youtubers and tech sites finally got ahold of the new stealth PS5 models, Blizzard is changing a number of names of characters and places in their games due to the recent harassment lawsuit,

looks like Xbox will have a banner holiday.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Forza Horizon 5 reviewing well and the Halo multiplayer tests getting a lot of positive reception, Xbox may have a couple of small surprises like The Gunk to help bolster it\u2019s holiday selection even further. Not to mention Game Pass has become quite the attraction on it\u2019s own. There are also all the other exclusives on the way after 2021 as well as rumor floating around that another Bethesda level acquisition is in the works.\r\n\r\nIn other news; the Steam Deck was delayed, Amazon\u2019s MMO New Wold is buggy and losing players, Ubisoft employees are still pissed, and Call of Duty Black Ops is back on the menu for next year.\r\n\r\nThis week\u2019s 5-Second review asks the big questions and even though the Coming Soon section is a little smaller this week - that doesn\u2019t mean there isn't a gem or two in there.
