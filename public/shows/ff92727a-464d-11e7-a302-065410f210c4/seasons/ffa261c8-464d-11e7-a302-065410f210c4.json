That makes strike two. Here's comes the Jack Pattillo secret shake-up. An absolutely unprecedented technique never before seen in the Baseball Achunter Little League (or BALL for short). Jack cradles six balls in his massive man-hands. He pitches.BAM! Gavin makes contact with one of the balls and sends it sailing. WHICK! Another ball flies straight into the catcher's glove. And the other four go way way way off course.Gavin has just gotten a hit, a strike-out, and a walk all at the same time. This is one for the history books, folks. We're honestly not sure how to count this one, but the decision could mean an early end for the Achievement Hunter season. Funhaus could very well take home the trophy this year.
