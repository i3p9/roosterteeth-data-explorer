Over the course of three seasons and a movie, Drawn Together broke barriers and riled censors. \r\nThe show was a love letter to both cartoons and reality TV — the ultimate genre ship. It took familiar cartoon archetypes, fit them into typical reality TV roles, and made fun of the worst traits of both.\r\nIt was the number two series on the network (just behind South Park), and was insanely popular on college campuses. Despite all of that, the ax came down and the series was cut short.\r\nA decade after the The Drawn Together Movie wrapped the series, the cast and creators came together (with us!) to spill behind-the-scenes secrets and celebrate the legacy of this groundbreaking series. Of course, it doesn’t hurt that our own Tara Strong voiced two(!!!) of the show’s main characters.","length":3970,"original_air_date":"2020-12-03T16:00:00.000Z","channel_id":"cb748682-3335-4faf-8fce-1273da49aa20","channel_slug":"friends-of-rt","season_id":"403011e2-1916-4804-931f-d2494e5c76ad","season_slug":"the-ship-it-show-the-ship-it-show","season_number":1,"show_title":"The Ship-it Show","show_id":"72049b25-64bd-4d71-a562-52fcc712b257","show_slug":"the-ship-it-show","is_sponsors_only":false},"uuid":"074fb74b-1dad-4b7a-83b2-2074e3d98afc","archive":{"id":"roosterteeth-41587","status":"archived","files":[{"name":"2020-12-03_We_Ship_Drawn_Together_and_Its_Insane_Characters_with_the_Shows_Creators_and_Cast_-_Part_1_of_2_[41587].description","filesize":903,"file_ext":"description","md5":"3a20518db0ea2b66aa7a8ca4b51f3a34"},{"name":"2020-12-03_We_Ship_Drawn_Together_and_Its_Insane_Characters_with_the_Shows_Creators_and_Cast_-_Part_1_of_2_[41587].info.json","filesize":20699,"file_ext":"json","md5":"41b6fb3ea8ef59fe9e65d5194e3ca68b"},{"name":"2020-12-03_We_Ship_Drawn_Together_and_Its_Insane_Characters_with_the_Shows_Creators_and_Cast_-_Part_1_of_2_[41587].jpg","filesize":255424,"file_ext":"jpg","md5":"136ee8dad9b4409a4267c126d7a16478"},{"name":"2020-12-03_We_Ship_Drawn_Together_and_Its_Insane_Characters_with_the_Shows_Creators_and_Cast_-_Part_1_of_2_[41587].mp4","filesize":2082888052,"file_ext":"mp4","md5":"13035c4be07e63c4e34df533399af1ba"}]}},{"id":41651,"type":"episode","attributes":{"title":"We Ship Drawn Together’s Foxxy Love and Clara, plus Xandir and Cosplay - Part 2 of 2","slug":"shipping-drawn-together-s-foxxy-love-clara-and-xandir-plus-cosplay","number":10,"description":"Drawn Together was raunchy, racy, rude, and revolutionary.
