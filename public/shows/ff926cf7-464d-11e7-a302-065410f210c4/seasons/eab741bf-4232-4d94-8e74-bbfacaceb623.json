We\u2019ve grown a bit smaller as our cast has moved on to work on exciting new ventures, including Inside Gaming and VTubing. Today, we are pleased to announce the launch of Dogbark, a new content group featuring Michael Jones, Alfredo Diaz, Trevor Collins, and Joe Lee. \r\n\r\n\r\nRooster Teeth is at its best when employees have been given the opportunity to pursue new creative passions. Fifteen years ago, this meant giving Geoff the ability to create Achievement Hunter. And today, this means letting the Achievement Hunter cast move on to new creative projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the last few years, this has allowed our cast to put time into creating F**kface, ANMA, Red Web, Face Jam, and more. More recently, Jack and BK have put their efforts into streaming at Inside Gaming, Lindsay has begun exploring Vtubing as Ruby, and Ky is producing multiple projects, including some of those listed above.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all of our new focuses, this means we will not be actively creating content for the Achievement Hunter channel. Let\u2019s Play will also look a little bit different moving forward, but we can assure you that it\u2019s not going anywhere, and it\u2019s in great hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut why Dogbark, and not just new shows under the Achievement Hunter banner? At this point in our creative careers, we have grown as both people and as entertainers. Much like how early Achievement Hunter evolved from video game guides to Let\u2019s Plays, we\u2019re looking to take Dogbark in a bold new direction that is more heavily focused on improv and sketch comedy. It\u2019s new. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s weird. And it\u2019s such a departure from what Achievement Hunter has been that we feel Dogbark is truly its own thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re very excited to share these projects with all of you, and we really do hope you\u2019ll enjoy all the new content we have in store. Through the years, we\u2019ve reached heights we never thought possible\u2013from Haunter to the Hardcore series, from RTX Panels to AH Live Tours. Whether you joined us back in 2008 or 2023, we couldn\u2019t have done this without you. We have been met with so much support as we\u2019ve grown and changed over the years, and we can\u2019t thank you enough for that.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know this news might be shocking and saddening for you. It\u2019s bittersweet. On one hand, we\u2019re saying \u201cSee you later\u201d to a truly indescribable brand. On the other, we\u2019re getting to pursue new passions, explore, test ourselves as creators, and that\u2019s an incredibly exciting experience. It\u2019s hard to do the same thing for our whole lives, and we shouldn\u2019t have to. But, just because we\u2019re not a part of AH anymore doesn\u2019t mean that we didn\u2019t appreciate the time spent there, or with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s okay to be sad; it\u2019s okay to take time to process. After, when you\u2019re ready, come join us over at Inside Gaming, F**kface, RWBY\u2019s Twitch, Dogbark, Red Web, Face Jam, ANMA, and So\u2026Alright. We\u2019ll be waiting for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLove, \r\n-AH\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more Rooster Teeth Updates, watch here: \r\nhttps://roosterteeth.com/watch/rttv-specials-2023-rooster-teeth-announcement\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport Us On First: roosterteeth.com/signup", "display_title": "We Have An Announcement\u2026", "length": 315, "advert_config": null, "advertising": true, "ad_timestamps": "157.00", "public_golive_at": "2023-09-18T14:00:00.000Z", "sponsor_golive_at": "2023-09-18T14:00:00.000Z", "member_golive_at": "2023-09-18T14:00:00.000Z", "original_air_date": "2023-09-18T14:00:00.000Z", "channel_id": "2cb2a70c-be50-46f5-93d7-84a1baabb4f7", "channel_slug": "achievement-hunter", "season_id": "eab741bf-4232-4d94-8e74-bbfacaceb623", "season_slug": "achievement-hunter-2023", "season_number": 2023, "show_title": "Achievement Hunter", "show_id": "ff926cf7-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4", "show_slug": "achievement-hunter", "is_sponsors_only": false, "member_tier_i": -1, "sort_number": 20230003, "genres": ["Gaming"], "is_live": true, "is_schedulable": false, "season_order": "desc", "episode_order": "desc", "downloadable": true, "blacklisted_countries": [], "upsell_next": false, "trending_score": 1.0, "time_boost": 23.091814, "credits_start_at": null, "trending_carousel": null}, "uuid": "674ccf33-804e-4dca-9944-ef5ffcb9026c", "canonical_links": {"self": "/watch/achievement-hunter-2023-achievement-hunter-announcement", "show": "/series/achievement-hunter"}, "archive": {"id": "roosterteeth-51566", "status": "archived", "files": [{"name": "2023-09-18_We_Have_An_Announcement_[51566].description", "filesize": 4091, "file_ext": "description", "md5": "d98294d8222fb7cde61698686f321b70"}, {"name": "2023-09-18_We_Have_An_Announcement_[51566].info.json", "filesize": 23681, "file_ext": "json", "md5": "1ecb08d0cd1eab6ffee065f1ccb3678b"}, {"name": "2023-09-18_We_Have_An_Announcement_[51566].mp4", "filesize": 165333332, "file_ext": "mp4", "md5": "6aef756f3dc45b5880857f9810f5a20f"}, {"name": "2023-09-18_We_Have_An_Announcement_[51566].png", "filesize": 232340, "file_ext": "png", "md5": "d5fcfc5f5bd5b7598204054b569b7aff"}]}}, {"id": 51618, "type": "episode", "attributes": {"title": "VS Episode 150: Joe vs. BK", "slug": "achievement-hunter-2023-9-24", "rating": null, "caption": "Six years ago, we promised VS would come back with a NEW trophy, a NEW belt, and a NEW roster of competitors.
