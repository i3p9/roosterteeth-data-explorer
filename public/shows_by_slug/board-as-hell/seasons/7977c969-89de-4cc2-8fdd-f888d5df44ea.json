To me, being a YouTuber was better than being President of the United States. Even before I first wandered into the Funhaus Office for an afterschool job I knew I wanted to be a part of them. It was there that I knew that I belonged. To me, it meant being somebody in the neighborhood that was full of nobodies. They werenâ€™t like anybody else. I mean, they did whatever they wanted. They double parked in front of a GameStop and nobody ever game them a ticket. In the summer when we played Overwatch all night, nobody ever called the cops. We had it all. One day some of the kids from the neighborhood carried Baby Boy Jacob's groceries all the way home for him.
