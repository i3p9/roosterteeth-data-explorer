Pepper it and drizzle some olive oil.2) Put you cast iron skillet on the stove at medium high.3) Take the steaks -- which should be at room temperature or at least have been out of the fridge a bit -- and season them to your liking.4) Toss a knob of butter in the skillet and spread it around.5) Toss the steak in there. Let it cook for 3 minutes if you want a rare steak like me. Four for medium rare. Any longer than that and you are a crazy person who wants to ruin steak.6) Flip it. Let it cook for the same amount of time you let the first side cook for.7) Pull it off and let it rest a spell on the cutting board.8) Cut it up into strips. 9) Put it over the salad, sprinkle some Parmesan, and you have a classy ass date meal.Follow us on Twitter!Greg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggyNick - http://www.twitter.com/Nick_ScarpinoKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids","length":61,"original_air_date":"2019-01-19T17:04:37.000Z","channel_id":"6ce10ccb-f945-4b21-b157-5c5619bf1de3","channel_slug":"kinda-funny","season_id":"b40b43eb-1f9a-449b-a7db-2e381d586bfb","season_slug":"cooking-with-greggy-season-1","season_number":1,"show_title":"Cooking With Greggy","show_id":"7fbe4da3-997c-4274-a4dc-5b1a73fcb55d","show_slug":"cooking-with-greggy","is_sponsors_only":false},"uuid":"b91d76e0-efff-40b0-9deb-e32349a8db82","archive":{"id":"roosterteeth-31439","status":"archived","files":[{"name":"2019-01-19_Debut_Trailer_[31439].description","filesize":1450,"file_ext":"description","md5":"2b4249b94261eb6148842120592dc396"},{"name":"2019-01-19_Debut_Trailer_[31439].info.json","filesize":20989,"file_ext":"json","md5":"dc1e0e3278fea9f070ca1447a990c0dc"},{"name":"2019-01-19_Debut_Trailer_[31439].jpg","filesize":154628,"file_ext":"jpg","md5":"f115d6099fc1bcddaca42cca551b8c55"},{"name":"2019-01-19_Debut_Trailer_[31439].mp4","filesize":31125570,"file_ext":"mp4","md5":"4c9e575020f4224e81314b176f5e830f"}]}},{"id":31438,"type":"episode","attributes":{"title":"How to Make Firehouse Chicken","slug":"cooking-with-greggy-season-1-how-to-make-firehouse-chicken-cooking-with-greggy-ep-2","number":3,"description":"Subscribe! http://www.youtube.com/kindafunny?sub...Get Cooking with Greggy one week early: http://www.patreon.com/kindafunnyBuy the Cooking with Greggy Shirt: http://www.kindafunny.com/storeFIREHOUSE CHICKEN STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS1) Purée garlic, vinegar, olive oil, salt, parsley, paprika, pepper, and ½ cup vegetable oil in a blender until smooth.

Deglaze with white wine, add sprigs of thyme and bring to a boil. Add mussels, cover pan with lid. Steam for 4-5 minutes or until mussels start opening up, gradually transferring them to shallow serving bowls as they open. After 8-10 minutes, discard any that have not opened. Once all mussels have been taken out of the pan, add cream and stir, bringing sauce to a simmer. Season with salt & pepper, and ladle mix onto mussels in serving bowls. Serve with buttered, charred slices of crusted bread, fries on the side. FRIES INGREDIENTS- Canola oil for frying (enough to submerge fries in a deep pan) - 2 yukon gold potatoes, cut in long sticks- Kosher salt- Pepper- Rosemary or other herbs if you're feeling crazy.FRIES STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS1) Dice dem taters into sticks. Y;know, the size of fries you'd wanna eat.2) Toss the finished sticks into a bowl of cold water to destarch them. Dump out the cloudy water, put more cold water in. Repeat until the water in the bowl is no longer cloudy.3) Over in your cast iron skillet, dump in a good layer of canola oil. You want to submerge the fries, but you don't need to overdo it. Heat over medium high.4) While the oil is heating up, pull the fries out of the water and put'em on a clean towel. Pat them dry.5) OK, the oil's hot? Great. Put the fries in carefully. Don't overcrowd. You'd going to do this in batches.6) Once the fries change texture (they'll go from glossy to matte), pull them out and put them on a paper towel.7) Put in the next batch. Do it again.8) OK, start tossing in the partially fried fries. Let'em go until they're the brown and crispy fries you like. 9) Pull'em out, toss'em back on a paper towel, and salt, pepper, and herb those bad boys.10) Serve!Follow us on Twitter!Greg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggyNick - http://www.twitter.com/Nick_ScarpinoKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids","length":958,"original_air_date":"2019-01-19T17:04:37.000Z","channel_id":"6ce10ccb-f945-4b21-b157-5c5619bf1de3","channel_slug":"kinda-funny","season_id":"b40b43eb-1f9a-449b-a7db-2e381d586bfb","season_slug":"cooking-with-greggy-season-1","season_number":1,"show_title":"Cooking With Greggy","show_id":"7fbe4da3-997c-4274-a4dc-5b1a73fcb55d","show_slug":"cooking-with-greggy","is_sponsors_only":false},"uuid":"aba4c40b-5ef6-453c-9bd4-982a7526760d","archive":{"id":"roosterteeth-31444","status":"archived","files":[{"name":"2019-01-19_Make_these_Mussels_Fries_[31444].description","filesize":2896,"file_ext":"description","md5":"e8c11a7974cfba7f1006ed8f91a8d71d"},{"name":"2019-01-19_Make_these_Mussels_Fries_[31444].info.json","filesize":22521,"file_ext":"json","md5":"4d1d8631ec46a02914816309a6779769"},{"name":"2019-01-19_Make_these_Mussels_Fries_[31444].jpg","filesize":148349,"file_ext":"jpg","md5":"e5e0034154fb2386e0abc0e45a6b2767"},{"name":"2019-01-19_Make_these_Mussels_Fries_[31444].mp4","filesize":499640613,"file_ext":"mp4","md5":"9a6d94c8087b6968248af7ae3cc1692a"}]}},{"id":31442,"type":"episode","attributes":{"title":"Make the Most Impressive Dinner Ever","slug":"cooking-with-greggy-season-1-make-the-most-impressive-dinner-ever-cooking-with-greggy","number":10,"description":"Get your Team Fat apron by supporting us the month of October 2017 on http://www.patreon.com/kindafunny at the fan mail tier!Subscribe! http://www.youtube.com/kindafunny?sub...Support us and get EVERY episode of Cooking with Greggy one week early: http://www.patreon.com/kindafunnyGet your Cooking with Greggy shirt here: http://www.kindafunny.com/storeTHE RECIPE: https://www.rachaelraymag.com/recipe/...Follow us on Twitter!Greg - http://www.twitter.com/GameOverGreggyNick - http://www.twitter.com/Nick_ScarpinoKinda Funny - http://www.twitter.com/KindaFunnyVids","length":1248,"original_air_date":"2019-01-19T17:04:37.000Z","channel_id":"6ce10ccb-f945-4b21-b157-5c5619bf1de3","channel_slug":"kinda-funny","season_id":"b40b43eb-1f9a-449b-a7db-2e381d586bfb","season_slug":"cooking-with-greggy-season-1","season_number":1,"show_title":"Cooking With Greggy","show_id":"7fbe4da3-997c-4274-a4dc-5b1a73fcb55d","show_slug":"cooking-with-greggy","is_sponsors_only":false},"uuid":"2a2be0bd-06bf-4730-8a3e-a4b0eac68e51","archive":{"id":"roosterteeth-31442","status":"archived","files":[{"name":"2019-01-19_Make_the_Most_Impressive_Dinner_Ever_[31442].description","filesize":564,"file_ext":"description","md5":"0f19c9fb3cc94bd44074a233218077c0"},{"name":"2019-01-19_Make_the_Most_Impressive_Dinner_Ever_[31442].info.json","filesize":20245,"file_ext":"json","md5":"0920a213803fcaa85c6636e7bc0ce403"},{"name":"2019-01-19_Make_the_Most_Impressive_Dinner_Ever_[31442].jpg","filesize":176122,"file_ext":"jpg","md5":"9122c957c4f7f15504758949cea640be"},{"name":"2019-01-19_Make_the_Most_Impressive_Dinner_Ever_[31442].mp4","filesize":652523765,"file_ext":"mp4","md5":"f2cb4c71a4000e2044d01844e4030ae4"}]}},{"id":31445,"type":"episode","attributes":{"title":"Season 1 Leftovers","slug":"cooking-with-greggy-season-1-cooking-with-greggy-season-1-leftovers","number":11,"description":"Cooking With Greggy's eight-episode run is over, but we still have a final course!
