His Participation is higher than it's ever been, and we're really proud of his performance in Collaboration, Forensics, and especially Gym. Seriously: what have you been feeding this guy - he's lifting like CRAZY! However, there are still numerous areas that need significant improvement. Reading and Art Comprehension continue to escape Fun, and we're very concerned with his ability to perform simple Math, Science, and Geography skills. He's lacking some basic functional knowledge of Business and Performance as well. As a result of all this, I'm afraid I'm going to have to assign your son Fun Haus an average grade of D+.
