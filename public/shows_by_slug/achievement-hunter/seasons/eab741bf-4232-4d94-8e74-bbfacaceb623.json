We’ve grown a bit smaller as our cast has moved on to work on exciting new ventures, including Inside Gaming and VTubing. Today, we are pleased to announce the launch of Dogbark, a new content group featuring Michael Jones, Alfredo Diaz, Trevor Collins, and Joe Lee. \r\n\r\n\r\nRooster Teeth is at its best when employees have been given the opportunity to pursue new creative passions. Fifteen years ago, this meant giving Geoff the ability to create Achievement Hunter. And today, this means letting the Achievement Hunter cast move on to new creative projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the last few years, this has allowed our cast to put time into creating F**kface, ANMA, Red Web, Face Jam, and more. More recently, Jack and BK have put their efforts into streaming at Inside Gaming, Lindsay has begun exploring Vtubing as Ruby, and Ky is producing multiple projects, including some of those listed above.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all of our new focuses, this means we will not be actively creating content for the Achievement Hunter channel. Let’s Play will also look a little bit different moving forward, but we can assure you that it’s not going anywhere, and it’s in great hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut why Dogbark, and not just new shows under the Achievement Hunter banner? At this point in our creative careers, we have grown as both people and as entertainers. Much like how early Achievement Hunter evolved from video game guides to Let’s Plays, we’re looking to take Dogbark in a bold new direction that is more heavily focused on improv and sketch comedy. It’s new. It’s fun. It’s weird. And it’s such a departure from what Achievement Hunter has been that we feel Dogbark is truly its own thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe’re very excited to share these projects with all of you, and we really do hope you’ll enjoy all the new content we have in store. Through the years, we’ve reached heights we never thought possible–from Haunter to the Hardcore series, from RTX Panels to AH Live Tours. Whether you joined us back in 2008 or 2023, we couldn’t have done this without you. We have been met with so much support as we’ve grown and changed over the years, and we can’t thank you enough for that.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know this news might be shocking and saddening for you. It’s bittersweet. On one hand, we’re saying “See you later” to a truly indescribable brand. On the other, we’re getting to pursue new passions, explore, test ourselves as creators, and that’s an incredibly exciting experience. It’s hard to do the same thing for our whole lives, and we shouldn’t have to. But, just because we’re not a part of AH anymore doesn’t mean that we didn’t appreciate the time spent there, or with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s okay to be sad; it’s okay to take time to process. After, when you’re ready, come join us over at Inside Gaming, F**kface, RWBY’s Twitch, Dogbark, Red Web, Face Jam, ANMA, and So…Alright. We’ll be waiting for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLove, \r\n-AH\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more Rooster Teeth Updates, watch here: \r\nhttps://roosterteeth.com/watch/rttv-specials-2023-rooster-teeth-announcement\r\n\r\n\r\nSupport Us On First: roosterteeth.com/signup","length":315,"original_air_date":"2023-09-18T14:00:00.000Z","channel_id":"2cb2a70c-be50-46f5-93d7-84a1baabb4f7","channel_slug":"achievement-hunter","season_id":"eab741bf-4232-4d94-8e74-bbfacaceb623","season_slug":"achievement-hunter-2023","season_number":2023,"show_title":"Achievement Hunter","show_id":"ff926cf7-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","show_slug":"achievement-hunter","is_sponsors_only":false},"uuid":"674ccf33-804e-4dca-9944-ef5ffcb9026c","archive":{"id":"roosterteeth-51566","status":"archived","files":[{"name":"2023-09-18_We_Have_An_Announcement_[51566].description","filesize":4091,"file_ext":"description","md5":"d98294d8222fb7cde61698686f321b70"},{"name":"2023-09-18_We_Have_An_Announcement_[51566].info.json","filesize":23681,"file_ext":"json","md5":"1ecb08d0cd1eab6ffee065f1ccb3678b"},{"name":"2023-09-18_We_Have_An_Announcement_[51566].mp4","filesize":165333332,"file_ext":"mp4","md5":"6aef756f3dc45b5880857f9810f5a20f"},{"name":"2023-09-18_We_Have_An_Announcement_[51566].png","filesize":232340,"file_ext":"png","md5":"d5fcfc5f5bd5b7598204054b569b7aff"}]}},{"id":51618,"type":"episode","attributes":{"title":"VS Episode 150: Joe vs. BK","slug":"achievement-hunter-2023-9-24","number":4,"description":"Six years ago, we promised VS would come back with a NEW trophy, a NEW belt, and a NEW roster of competitors.
