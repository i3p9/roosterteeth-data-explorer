First came the official pricing and opening pre-orders for Nintendo’s amiibo figures. These NFC powered statues will release this holiday season for $13 each and are compatible with the Wii U version of Smash Bros. MMmmm… the packaging is sexy! And the fun won’t stop there, the dozen characters receiving the amiibo treatment will become compatible with even more titles like Mario Kart 8, Yoshi’s Woolly World, and Mario Party 10. More updates to functionality and new titles will be coming closer to the undisclosed launch date, including the teased reveal of a base station for the 3DS in 2015. LAME! Who wants a clumsy accessory for their portable device, why don’t you just make a new…  There’s a NEW 3DS!Hysterically named the “NEW” Nintendo 3DS, it was announced for fall release in Japan and comes in both standard and XL models. It has a larger screen, improved CPU, amiibo compatibility, stronger battery life annnddd a second analog stick?! Well actually it’s more of a nub modeled after the Gamecube’s C-stick, but let’s face it, it’s an IBM ThinkPad’s clitoris. Other bonuses include the addition of two more shoulder buttons, color-coded face buttons and improved 3D functionality so the viewing angle is better. These handhelds are releasing October 11th for 16,000 and 18,800 yen respectively, with no Western release planned for 2014. *Sad Panda* SO, expect them in the new year Nintendo fans and don’t forget there will be a Monster Hunter 4 limited edition if you can hold out long enough. As time goes on, I’m beginning to wonder how Nintendo can afford all these hardware revisions and special editions.In completely unrelated news, Nintendo of Europe laid off about 320 of its employees just yesterday. The Big N has been struggling overseas, releasing 130 internal employees, along with 190 contract, some of whom have worked for them for years. Luckily, they were informed of the transition back in June and had plenty of time to make preparations before they had to leave Nintendo of Europe’s German-based offices. Most of these employees were localization team members, alongside Q&A, all of which will be outsourced in the future to sentient amiibos. Hopefully, everyone affected by this lands on their feet and hey, new 3DS.

In a business savvy move, the company has entered into a partnership with Samsung to develop a product called Gear VR, using Oculus technology. In exchange, Oculus will get premium access to the Samsung screens used in the DK2 and future iterations of the Rift. Rift developer John Carmack is \"thrilled to reveal the Gear VR Innovator Edition, a state-of-the-art mobile VR experience powered by Oculus\". The device is basically compatible with the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and it will have users literally snapping their phones into the device. Oculus has also shown off technology that hints at future UI in VR products and devs will be able to start tinkering with the smartphone based Gear VR before the end of the year. So that's three VR headsets in our future, with a rumored fourth from Microsoft. That means we're only waiting on iOS and Ninten… hahaha, just iOS…In other news, Sony Japan blew hearts and minds by unleashing a flurry of PSP games on PlayStation Plus subscribers. For those fortunate enough to own PlayStation Vita, there are now 250 free PSP games available for download, IF you live in Japan. This was announced at a Sony briefing and as of now, it isn't expected to come to the West. There were also no details on which of the 374 games would be marked for free, but there are 250 free games waiting. The promotion will be available for the next two weeks and you can totally sign up for a Japanese account. I'd take advantage of this promo, but my 32 GB card is close to bursting and you fuckers still haven't released something like a 128 GB stick yet. How you gonna do this Sony? I always tell people what a pearl the Vita is, but now I'm going to harbor some resentment since you dropped this bomb on me.  I know what I said…And finally, I am going to talk about everyone's favorite YouTube personality, PewDiePie. That's right bros, Felix Kjellberg is gaming personality with the most popular channel on YouTube sporting a staggering 30 million subscribers. He has been the subject of many an article concerning success on the video platform, but it looks like Google has failed him in keeping up with his community. In a bold move, Felix has decided to shut off his comments completely for all future videos. In a recent vlog explaining his position, the content creator points to an overwhelming number of viewers who only comment to spam, self-advertise, and provoke other fans into toxic behavior. He is still interested in what his community has to say and will be keeping the dialogue open on services like Twitter and Reddit. BUT, it must be hard for YouTube to have its most successful channel call out the service provider for having a shit communication tool. So let's all learn from this to be friendly in our own comments… You're already telling me to die in a fire aren't you?I'm Sean and I'm a giant dick face.","length":226,"original_air_date":"2014-09-03T13:48:00.000Z","channel_id":"92b6bb21-91d2-4b1b-bf95-3268fa0d9939","channel_slug":"rooster-teeth","season_id":"ffa2901d-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","season_slug":"hard-news-season-1","season_number":1,"show_title":"Hard News","show_id":"ff932b21-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","show_slug":"hard-news","is_sponsors_only":false},"uuid":"0017d41a-464e-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","archive":{"id":"roosterteeth-6982","status":"archived","files":[{"name":"2014-09-03_PewDiePie_closes_comments_Oculus_teams_with_Samsung_FREE_PSP_games_in_Japan__Hard_News_932014_[6982].description","filesize":3077,"file_ext":"description","md5":"ec69dc185bcdc2056dd2ec3ba1e9442c"},{"name":"2014-09-03_PewDiePie_closes_comments_Oculus_teams_with_Samsung_FREE_PSP_games_in_Japan__Hard_News_932014_[6982].info.json","filesize":23109,"file_ext":"json","md5":"6eeed54ec82be15094f88eab2799f4b7"},{"name":"2014-09-03_PewDiePie_closes_comments_Oculus_teams_with_Samsung_FREE_PSP_games_in_Japan__Hard_News_932014_[6982].jpg","filesize":101267,"file_ext":"jpg","md5":"7dc166d16ae6b985bf23c7b496317b85"},{"name":"2014-09-03_PewDiePie_closes_comments_Oculus_teams_with_Samsung_FREE_PSP_games_in_Japan__Hard_News_932014_[6982].mp4","filesize":118903821,"file_ext":"mp4","md5":"2db220bb70d97459808181caed3076d2"}]}},{"id":6983,"type":"episode","attributes":{"title":"Gearbox does what it likes, Remote Play comes to Xperia, Ouya wants investors | Hard News 9/4/14","slug":"gearbox-does-what-it-likes-remote-play-comes-to-xperia-ouya-wants-investors-hard-news-9414","number":0,"description":"I'm Sean and this is Hard News for Thursday September 4th, 2014.    Ouya is rumored to be on the hunt for new investors or potential new ownership. According to GamesBeat, the Android powered micro-console has had acquisition talks with big players in the US like Google and Amazon, while also looking overseas to China. Some of those Chinese companies include Internet giant Tencent and a top smartphone distributor called Xiaomi, but there aren't many details beyond that. Oh and Ouya has yet to comment. Keep in mind that this wouldn't be an investment in the hardware, as much as it is Ouya's software. Their coalition of indie developers and a few exclusives might make them a perfect catch for say Amazon Fire TV or Google Play. Or it could be an example of how to take a successful Kickstarter and turn it into a failed business model, as quickly as possible. The glass is always half-full!    Now if you're really looking to the future of gaming, PS4's remote play continues to impress and Sony has no plans of pulling back on the feature. In fact, coming this November all three Xperia devices in the Z3 line of smartphones and tablets are remote play compatible. Just hop on the PS4 Wi-Fi and Bluetooth a controller, then BAM! Now you're playing The Last of Us Remastered on a smartphone. A big difference with these devices versus other remote play hardware is WiFi network has to be the same. Sony says theoretically you could play PS4 on the other side of the world with strong enough WiFi, but it might suck. There is also an attachment called the GCM10 Game Control Mount, which allows you to clip the phone to your Dual Shock. Good luck not looking like a complete tool while trying to use that device. This is a revelation for the service, Sony is finally getting into the handheld market, because you know… it isn't like they didn't already have an awesome portable that could us some support in the West. Like say 250 FREE PSP games?!    Anyways, we turn our eyes back to the ongoing class action lawsuit by fans against Sega and Gearbox Software for the abortion that is Colonial Marines. Now Sega has already offered a $1.25 million settlement, which is expected to be approved in two weeks. Gearbox had similar opportunity by pitching in another $750,000, but Gearbox wants out scot-free, citing the marketing was Sega's doing. Oh snap Gearbox! Sega doesn't give a fuck what you think and actually painted a very different picture in court and says that Gearbox led most of the marketing, panels, and E3 demo. Additionally, Gearbox kept leaking information without Sega's approval and when confronted by Sega, it was confirmed in an official email that the leaks came from Gearbox President Randy Pitchford \"\"doing whatever the fuck he likes”.

Apple has brought a new era of gaming to app fans around the world, by unveiling the Apple Watch in a press conference early yesterday. Alongside the iPhone 6 and 6+, Apple's new wearable promises the premiere Watch experience and celebrated by launching a new U2 album. Seriously… Anyway the watch has already had its first game announced, courtesy of Flying Tiger Entertainment. They quickly let everyone know they were working on something called iArm Wrestle Champs, of which was previously for iPhone and Android. That version has you crushing an iPhone in a feat of strength, but the Watch version might actually let you demean your friends more comfortably. You might not care about mobile games, but I think we can all appreciate the first Apple Watch game is being made by a company named Tiger.    In more big news, Microsoft is rumored to be out to purchase one rather significant indie developer. Yeah, the scuttlebutt around the old Wall Street Journal is that Microsoft is looking to acquire the company Mojang for $2 billion. The acquisition would include the games Scrolls and of course Minecraft. If it is actually happening, the deal will be finalized later this week. No one would of course care to comment on the situation, but I find this deal interesting for two reasons. First, Notch isn't a fan of big corporations, as he pulled Oculus support after the Facebook acquisition. Then you have Microsoft, who's a company that recently laid off 18,000 people from Xbox Entertainment Studios and closed the division entirely. Kind of Notch's anti-hero… And where did all the money come from?… Ohhhh… Sure, the lives of 18,000 families is certainly worth the cost of Minecraft.    And finally we end on another rumor. Wal-Mart may have leaked the North American version of the special edition 3DS XL of Super Smash. A leaked flier boasted both red and blue versions at $200 and appears to release on September 19. There is no mention of the European Bundle's digital copy of Smash, but won't stop you from buying it. The hardware is slightly different from the Japanese version, but all look pretty sexy. Too bad they aren't \"\"new” 3DS'. To celebrate the upcoming Saturday launch of Smash Bros on 3DS in Japan, Nintendo is going to be streaming on Twitch for eight hours the Friday before. There are no times, but expect a look at some upcoming games for Wii U and 3DS, followed by a peak at the final version of Super Smash Bros. We'll even have a page here on ScrewAttack.

I'm Sean Hinz and this is Hard News for Thursday, September 11th, 2014.  Sony is bringing to end an entire generation of mobile games for most of the world. As of September 15th, PSP owners will no longer be able to access the PSN storefront in regions like Europe, Oceania, Asia, and some Africa. Sure, you could always make purchases via the Sony Entertainment Network and then download via your purchase history, but really, this is the publisher closing the book on its first true foray into portables. North America will continue to have access, along with Japan of course, but it seems like an end of days scenario. Sounds like the perfect time to make sure every digital PSP game works on Vita, right Sony? I still can't believe the Wii Shop Channel out survived the PSP…  Speaking of beating a dead horse, there's a new Final Fantasy game coming from Square Enix in Japan, but it's another smartphone game. Titled Final Fantasy World Wide Words, the game borrows heavily from the Theaterhythm franchise art style, offering a word-based RPG using Texting of the Bread elements. *shameless* It is expected to include a return of the Chocobo farm and its crossbreading orgies, gaining access to customized words and money. Like All the Bravest, the game will be free, with microtransactions; but unlike All the Bravest, it won't give you \"\"cancer of the soul” after playing it. Then again it will as Square has been known to make the same mistake thrice. I guess the Japanese will find out when the game launches on iOS and Android September 16th. Hey Final Fantasy Committee, what the fuck are you doing?!  And lastly, we keep our eyes turned to Japan for the daily Super Smash Bros. update. Yesterday a demo was released in the land of the rising sun and Sakurai has confirmed that a North American one is on the way. Now you'd think a demo would be enough to bide people over for the next five days, but it wasn't… Some lucky fans have managed to get their hands on the full-game a few days early and stream it on Twitch for our viewing pleasure. So here are the official characters rounding out the final roster. Wario, Dr. Mario, Ganondorf, Mr. Game and Watch, Duckhunt Dog and Dark Pit. Basically the previously leaked list of combatants. Also Ness and Falco are rumored to be returning across social media. No word on the DLC characters like Ice Climbers or Snake, but clearly the leaks were spot on. Be sure to tune in tomorrow for the Nintendo Treehouse livestream, I suspect many of these characters will be official in the next 24 hours.

Owner Markus \"\"Notch” Persson has decided to leave the company after the acquisition takes place and Microsoft promises to continue to develop the game for multiple platforms. That means in a bizarre move that this will be one of the first times PlayStation will license a Microsoft game, for Minecraft's release on Vita. Despite confirming many of the previously heard rumors from last week, something that many fans will find interesting is the Dear John letter from Notch on departing the company. You see, it's not you, it's him. Notch feels he \"\"is not an entrepreneur… not a CEO.” He's just a programmer that wants to retain his sanity and no longer be a symbol of some larger industry movement. I can sympathize with Notch over the pressure that comes with being the face of something larger than yourself. How nice it must be to lack the ambition to grow as a person and become a leader in your community, to instead return to his roots as a lowly programmer... with a billion dollars.    In other Microsoft news, it appears that Mojang may not be the only rumor turned reality that we can expect to see in the future. A \"\"report” on NeoWin claims Microsoft is working on a browser-based streaming technology that could be used to play Xbox 360 games and even float the Xbox 360 dashboard for users to access their content from just about any Windows powered device.This would put Microsoft technologies on par with say something like PlayStation Now or OnLive. There are even rumors about Xbox One games getting the treatment as well, but all things in time. It shouldn't come as a big surprise Microsoft is choosing this route, because the Xbox One already offloads much of its computing power to the Azure Cloud. Bringing some sort of streaming service to a browser seems like the next logical step for their technology. Let's just hope that the service turns out a whole lot better than their motion controls did, because at this point my Kinects are both sitting in a corner… jerking each other off into infinity.    And lastly, we turn our eyes back to Nintendo for another Super Smash Bros. update. First is the leak of an actual release date for the Wii U version of the game in North America on November 21st from retailer Fred Meyer. This would make it available just in time for Black Friday which is pretty much what all Americans aspire to, because we are gluttonous monsters. A Friday release sounds about right, but let's just wait for Nintendo's official date before we get too excited. Beyond the retail leaks, the North American demo seems to imply you can use your 3DS as a controller while playing the Wii U version of Super Smash Bros. Add this to the list of all the other controller options such as the GameCube controller adapter or even the Pro Controller and you significantly reduce the possibility of your shitty friend sticking with the WiiMote and Nunchuck.

I'm Sean Hinz and this is Hard News for Friday September 12th, 2014.  Grand Theft Auto V had its next-gen release dates revealed courtesy of Rockstar and Take-Two; and it looks like you won't have to wait too long to get your hi-def Trevor fix. The console version will arrive on PS4 and Xbox One November 18th, just in time for the holiday rush. While the PC version will launch on January 27th of 2015, to the delight of modders and sandbox fans alike. Rockstar points out just how the game has been improved upon in almost every way whether its more detailed environments or a wider variety of activities to engage in. Additionally they're bringing 100 new songs and DJ mixes for you to shake your seat muffin to and previous gen owners will be able to transfer all their progression to a next gen system. YouTuber DomisLive may have also leaked the unconfirmed price of $50 via PSN. Great news, it looks like you'll be getting GTA V at a discount this holiday. So this brings up an important question… Where the hell are heists in GTA Online?!  Now we all know the truth behind Atari's famous E.T. landfill, but what are they going to do with the recently discovered carts? Why profit of course. Of the nearly 800,000 games suspected to have been buried in the Alamogordo Landfill, around 1300 were unearthed in the famous excavation of 10,000 pounds of garbage earlier this year. The city council has voted unanimously that those carts are going to be sent to museums around the world and auctioned off to gain a better understanding of their value in the open market. 800 games have been set aside to be auctioned in one of three lots. The first to appear on ebay in the next few weeks. No word on what the money will be used for, but I have a hunch that Arizona will use it to build a giant wall on the border of Mexico and paint an Atari logo on it.  And lastly, terror at the White House yesterday when a rogue Pokemon Trainer wandered onto the front lawn of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and subsequently had his ass handed to him by secret service. That's right, on September 11th, an idiot in a Pikachu hat, holding a Pikachu plush, decided to go for a stroll through Obama's yard. The secret service quickly overwhelmed him by using the move tackle and as you can see their Pokemon German Shepard is about to use bite. Considering the POTUS wasn't even home that day, I think it's going to be awhile before that trainer catches the legendary Obama. Anyway, I think we all learned a valuable lesson today.

Are you a PlayStation fanboy? Do you want to share your love of gaming and sports with the real world? Well Jonny Barry from FreakerSNEAKS was inspired by the recent launch of the PS4 to develop the PlayStation Jordans. A pair of Air Jordan IV's modified to sport a number of PlayStation 4 aesthetics, including a non-working HDMI port on the back of the heel. They even come with a custom Jumpman 23 HDMI cable, which can be used to keep your shoes together. Unfortunately sneakerheads will need to cough up $1000 to get one of the limited 10 pairs available in the initial release. It's a sad state in gaming when a pair of sneakers RUN at a higher resolution than the Xbox One.    Back to PlayStation though, Guerrilla Games just had their concept art for a new project leaked in a Chinese forum. The first party Sony developer is working on something called Horizon and just by looking at the concept art, we might be in for a treat. Both scenes depict massive mechanical monsters, roaming through epic landscapes. And the second image even shows some humans trying to take a mighty beast down. While we know almost nothing about the game, on paper the concept seems pretty fun. A three-person fireteam battles epic enemies across beautiful landscapes, while incorporating social elements... It's a good thing we don't already have something like that. Which everyone is playing. EVERY. WAKING. MOMENT.    Xbox 360 on the other hand is getting a new holiday bundle or three shipping to retailers today. The first two are your standard new generation 360; one centered around Kinect games, the other around Call of Duty and both for $250. Then you have the Arctic Blue bundle, which is limited to Walmart customers and is the same as the Call of Duty bundle, just blue! Why this color you may ask? Well they probably looked at the sales numbers for the PS4 and then blue themselves. Now I know some of you are rolling your eyes at the idea of buying a previous generation custom console. Old games are old. So for all you rich pricks, the Dubai retailer Jumbo Electronics is selling custom gold PS4s and Xbones.

In some Final Fantasy news that isn't a horrid abuse of the franchises legacy, we might get to play a little Final Fantasy XV, by 2015. GameInformer has revealed that fans who purchase the Final Fantasy Type-0 HD port, due March 17th of next year, will be treated to a demo of Final Fantasy XV. Type-0 was a PSP release exclusive to Japan from 2011 and the HD port will be launching on PS4 and Xbox One in North America, Japan, and Europe. GameInformer must have published their post a bit early, because after everyone ran with the story, they pulled the entire article. It's a good thing we had that picture as proof of their folly. With TGS this week, here's hoping Japan doesn't beat GameInformer's ass too hard for leaking this news.    While we are over in the land of the rising sun, let's have a look at Sony's financial state and man does it seem like a sinking ship these days. In spite of all the success they've experienced on the PlayStation side of the business, everything else is struggling and that is leading to a sizable loss for the year and we aren't done yet. In July the loss was forecasted at 50 billion yen, but after a few months go by, Sony now expects a whopping 230 billion yen loss. That's over $2 billion dollars and at least half if not more of that is coming from their smartphone division. In the two years since Kaz Hirai became CEO, this is the sixth revision downward and things may only get worse before they get better. I suppose that is why PlayStation Now pricing is so batshit insane. They're using it to try and save the entire company!    And lastly, PDP isn't just making that sweet Smash Bros. Wii U controller. The accessory designer has received the rights to make a fightpad for the upcoming release of Mortal Kombat X. Iron Galaxy CM Alex Jebailey posted some pics of the prototype on Instagram, revealing a lopsided six button fightpad. FYI, that stick on the side isn't analog, but is instead a series of microswitches to simulate that \"\"arcade feel” from a traditional joystick. PDP says \"\"the controllers are designed along the lines of our VS Fight Pads which came out for the Xbox 360 and PS3 a few years back.\"\" The one released alongside the arrival of MvC 3. With Mortal Kombat X due to arrive this April on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC I suspect the final version of this new controller isn't far behind. No official price, but they were $40 back in the day, which is way cheaper than an Xbox One Arcade Stick.

Arabic media reports that a YouTube video titled Grand Theft Auto: Salil al-Sawarem is a promotional video for an upcoming game from the terrorist organization. The ISIS media wing, yes they have one of those too, is using the game to raise the morale of the mujahedin and to sway children to their cause. A mujahedin is a Muslim freedom fighter, most often associated with radical Islam. So is there a videogame coming from ISIS? Probably not. Just looking at the video provided, that's definitely GTA: San Andreas, only heavily edited to look like a jihad simulation complete with explosions, drive bys and the general fuck the police attitude that we too embrace as Americans. Ironically the one way we might be able to connect with this terrorist organization is through a gangster infused culture which celebrates violence. So much for society?!In more warmhearted news it appears the Videogame History Museum has in fact found a permanent home, right here in Texas. The museum has been a mainstay at a number of events including E3 and many local Gearbox community days, but was in need of a home for quite some time. Now thanks to the city of Frisco Texas, which is just 20 minutes from our offices, they will be moving to a 10,000 square-foot space within the Frisco discovery Center. Co-founders Sean Kelly and John Hardy told the Dallas News that they're excited about the new opportunity and outside of preserving games for generations, they intend to use the museum as an educational tool. The city will also spend up to $800,000 on building improvements and add extra parking, which patrons will start using for themselves in April of 2015. Between the museum and Gearbox Software, Frisco is becoming quite the city for gaming. Looks like we just moved to the wrong city…Finally, big news for PlayStation TV today, with reveals of both the entertainment line-up and a release date in North America and Europe. First and foremost, games. PlayStation TV will feature a huge library of nearly 700 compatible games at launch, featuring Vita hits like Killzone: Mercenary, Freedom Wars, and Muramasa Rebirth. Alongside PSP games, PSone Classics and PlayStation minis. Other entertainment plans include the launch of an Internet television service by years end in partnership with Viacom. Multiple Sony platforms, which include the PlayStation TV, will be incorporating PlayStation Now and other streaming services, like Viacom's 20 channels. Sony hopes to expand to other networks like DIscovery, Time Warner, and Starz. Lastly, the date and price are official and we will all be getting our hands on a PlayStation TV October 14th for $100. Ballers can get a bundle for $140 that includes the Lego Movie game, a PS3 controller, and an 8GB memory card. Walmart will even throw in Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time at no extra cost, other than dirtying your soul with Walmart scabbies. If only PlayStation Now pricing wasn't completely fucking insane…I'm Sean and THAT was Hard News.","length":224,"original_air_date":"2014-09-22T15:31:00.000Z","channel_id":"92b6bb21-91d2-4b1b-bf95-3268fa0d9939","channel_slug":"rooster-teeth","season_id":"ffa2901d-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","season_slug":"hard-news-season-1","season_number":1,"show_title":"Hard News","show_id":"ff932b21-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","show_slug":"hard-news","is_sponsors_only":false},"uuid":"0017873f-464e-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","archive":{"id":"roosterteeth-6995","status":"archived","files":[{"name":"2014-09-22_PlayStation_TV_Dated_ISIS_Makes_Game_Trailer_Videogame_Museum_in_Texas__Hard_News_92214_[6995].description","filesize":3191,"file_ext":"description","md5":"79cc19c040baf4c1211d23e45c5d35a1"},{"name":"2014-09-22_PlayStation_TV_Dated_ISIS_Makes_Game_Trailer_Videogame_Museum_in_Texas__Hard_News_92214_[6995].info.json","filesize":23185,"file_ext":"json","md5":"a6aa6b204f1c54e647cc0991696e4301"},{"name":"2014-09-22_PlayStation_TV_Dated_ISIS_Makes_Game_Trailer_Videogame_Museum_in_Texas__Hard_News_92214_[6995].jpg","filesize":108010,"file_ext":"jpg","md5":"9af429531963f88a91f95de75207ce36"},{"name":"2014-09-22_PlayStation_TV_Dated_ISIS_Makes_Game_Trailer_Videogame_Museum_in_Texas__Hard_News_92214_[6995].mp4","filesize":117341861,"file_ext":"mp4","md5":"e05e5aa60a96f9b7cef730422f180e50"}]}},{"id":6996,"type":"episode","attributes":{"title":"Nintendo 2DS for Pok?mon, AssCreed Season Pass, Triad Wars is F2P | Hard News 9/23/14","slug":"nintendo-2ds-for-pok-mon-asscreed-season-pass-triad-wars-is-f2p-hard-news-92314","number":0,"description":"I'm Sean Hinz and this is Hard News for Tuesday, September 23, 2014  Nintendo has decided that we just don't have enough custom handhelds right now, so here's two transparent 2DS' coming out in Europe. They look pretty damn sexy in blue and red, expected to release in late November, around the same time as Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. The handhelds will come bundled with a digital version of the respective game and the overall look is reminiscent of say an old Gameboy Color. My obvious issue though is these are still just a standard 2DS and not the recently announced \"\"new” 3DS, making it an outdated piece of hardware no matter how cool it looks. I mean come on and Nintendo! By my count there are over 24 color variations of 2DS/3DS/3DSXL in North America, while in Japan there are over 60. And we give Capcom shit for re-releasing the same thing over and over again.  Onto something that will never change, Ubisoft's season pass for Assassin's Creed Unity has been revealed. The biggest portion of which is entitled Dead Kings puts Arno in the city of Saint Denise, just outside of Paris after the events of Unity. It comes with plenty of additional content and will unlock over 30 weapons, items, and outfits. However, the biggest but the most interesting part of the Season Pass would have to be the inclusion of a 2.5D action platformer called Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China. It stars a female assassination named Shao Jun and takes place in the 16th century. You'll still be a free running stabby stab Assassin, but interacting in a gameplay style reminiscent of Prince of Persia. The price for all of these experiences is $30 and it will be releasing in early 2015. Three AssCreed games in a single year. THREE! Why don't you just include divorce papers with the Special Edition, because my wife won't be seeing me after November 11th.  And lastly Triad Wars is the latest game from United Front and it's a less of a sequel to the Sleeping Dogs franchise and more a spin-off free to play game that will encourage you to become the biggest gangster in all of Hong Kong. Just yesterday I mentioned we celebrate gangster culture and this game seems to be an extension of the very idea where you begin as a low-level enforcer and work to build your criminal empire through strength and street-smarts. It has you establishing your turf in the sandbox setting, managing criminal operations and expanding your reach into other players' territories. The devs make reference to raiding a few times, so expect some MMO ideas repurposed, but I can't help but feel like the entire trailer is a bunch devs telling me what this game without anything to back it up. Right now it's scheduled to launch exclusively on PC in early 2015 and you can register for a closed beta right now. They say in five years this game could evolve into something completely different, but I fear it's going to be the next APB.  If you share my skepticism, how about a Like? Or comment?

The Queen's Wrath event opened last night and will run through October 6th, featuring new bounties and remixed missions for weary guardians. The unique gear includes new weapons, shaders, and class specific armor; but no word on whether or not you can find a complete set. Legendaries are guaranteed though by completing a bounty, turning that into the Queen's Emissary and then completing a remixed story mission. After that you should receive two fixed legendary pieces, though it is recommended you're level 24 before embarking on this quest. Now we just had our first level 30 in the game and higher level players are complaining that the Queen's Wrath loot is a bit below their level. I on the other spent an hour shooting at the treasure cave last night and welcome the opportunity for guaranteed purps. I am flush with filthy casual greens for days.Yesterday Steam introduced an updated version of their launcher and storefront, adding a wealth of new ways to encourage you to buy more games. The most striking is the introduction of Curators. This is meant to improve a game's discoverability, but it has only taken 24 hours for users to start exploiting the service. Some are in it for the money, providing users not only advice on a game's quality, but where you can by a shady game key on the Internet and promptly get your information stolen. Others are in it for the LOLs, recommending that you go kill yourself or simply comparing everything to the cult-classic Postal. A great measure of a quality game of course. For Steam this seems like business as usual, with the same sort of trolls showing their face for the release of Steam reviews and Steam Tags, but maybe by empowering Curators, Valve is simply hoping to flush out a few assholes. And if there is one thing the Internet has in spades, it's assholes.Speaking of assholes, Blizzard's is raw from years of fucking itself trying to make their newest MMO, Titan, into the next black tar heroin of gaming. Considering the project was never technically officially announced, it must sting to know that seven years ago Blizzard was so full of hope that they could recreate the success of WoW a second time, only to have the dream die. Blizzard CEO Mike Morhaime is quoted as saying \"I wouldn't say no to ever doing an MMO again, but I can say that right now, that's not where we want to be spending our time.\" If you recall, the project hit a snag last year and was reset in order to right the ship. Obviously that just didn't happen... I imagine for Activision it's like spending the better part of a decade throwing benjamins into a furnace shaped like Jay Wilson's face. So it's official, Project Titan goes onto the shit shelf next to Shattered Nations, Warcraft Adventures, and StarCraft Ghost.I'm Sean and THAT was Hard News!Thanks for sticking around after Hard News, if you enjoyed this episode then give me a thumbs up and leave a comment.

Activision and it's bastard studios in Bucharest has been given the unfortunate task of developing a Duck Dynasty licensed game, which ties into the \"\"hit” reality TV show. These are the same devs behind the titular Cabela's franchise and that Men in Black game no one played from 2012. Duck Dynasty's game aims to make you a Robertson as you go duck hunting, fishing, airboat racing, and klu klux klanning through the neighborhood. It will be coming to PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, 3DS and… Well that's it. The story is a campaign of carnage as you pull pranks, blow-up shit and even engage in riveting first-person duck calling.

Right now Japan is having a sort of Wii U renaissance with the recent release of Hyrule Warriors and upcoming launch of Super Smash Bros. But there's another game that just released called Bayonetta 2 and it's pretty important. Yet Nintendo must have forgot the game, completely ignoring it's launch and the sales were abysmal. Bayonetta 2 in the first week of it's Japanese release is estimated to have sold around 30… thousand units. To put that in perspective, Smash for 3DS sold over 300,000 units that same week, its second week of sales. It's an awful state for Platinum Games to find their sequel in, considering the review scores have been high and Bayonetta screams kooky Japanese culture. Sales had better pick up over here in the West this October or this will certainly be the last in the franchise. There's only one explanation, this has to be the Wii U's fault.    Speaking of everyone's favorite next-gen platform, Ubisoft decided to take one last huge dump on the console before it peaces out. Watch Dogs has been confirmed to finally arrive on Wii U, November 18th, but it won't be a complete experience. The version that is being ported will not include the DLC which is already present on the other five platforms. that includes the Bad Blood story campaign, a digital trip, the Untouchables pack and additional single-player content. In fact, the Bad Blood DLC actually just went live on PlayStation and PC this week and will be live before the end of the month on Xbox. Ubisoft says that a sequel is in the works and they plan to address some of the issues players had with the original. Like the fact that it was an over-hyped sandbox game, set in a fictional Chicago with a paper-thin narrative, starring a morally bankrupt character who can't jump. And it probably won't make it to Wii U either.    Whelp, there goes my no Wii U joke streak. Feel free to rage in the comments.    I'm Sean and THAT was Hard News!

Sony revealed in a European PlayStation Forum that the social service would also be shutting its doors in March of 2015 overseas and this closure would extend to North America. Meaning that Home would no longer be a place where you can go and waste the few hours you have left in your life dancing with random strangers and attempt to watch a Sony press conference, fruitlessly. Additionally, publishing new content will stop on November 12th, and the ability to download said content goes away on the 3rd of December. Until then, Sony is going to offer \"free content” in celebration of the demise of Home, because nothing says the Rapture like free shit. Despite years of spending time in your home away from Home, it's time to say goodbye to your Second Life. And let's be honest, anyone devasted by this news probably needs to spend some time outside.If you really want to live vicariously through video games, why not play something fun like say Hyrule Warriors. The first DLC bits for the recent Nintendo release were revealed late last Friday and it's a horse of a different color, literally. In the game's first expansion, the Master Quest Pack, you can access to new scenarios, costumes, and Adventure Mode map, and a weapon. But not just any weapon, no, you'll gain access to the Hero of Time's trusty stead, Epona. Weighing in on Miiverse, Zelda director Eiji Aonuma gave his first impressions of the DLC and Epona's abilities. Apparently the weaponized equine will be able to \"blow herds of enemies away and gallop swiftly through the fields”, as she accompanies Link on his latest adventure. Well… until you run out of carrots and then she is all out of fucks. Expect more details before its October 16th release. Oh and eat shit Bethesda! Nintendo is about to show you how it's done when it comes to horse DLC.And Hyrule Warriors isn't the only game getting some great golden age Nintendo content. It's no secret that Bayonetta 2 is housing some amazing costumes from franchises we know and love, including Star Fox, but there is much much more to this Fox McCloud tribute. FYI, we're getting into spoiler territory, no bitching that I didn't warn you. As revealed all over the Internet, Bayonetta 2 will feature a Star Fox inspired fight scene where you pilot an Arwing, lock on to destroy enemies and even do a barrell roll or two. I mean aileron roll. Clearly Peppy lied to us all… The game hasn't been selling that well over in Japan and despite numbers only having had a few days to be reported on, many of us fans are hopeful that things will pick up over here in the west. Will this tribute to one of Nintendo's most famous franchises be enough? I guess we'll find out this October. It's kind of a miracle that Nintendo's newest leading lady is a cosplaying witch who basically killed God and makes Peach look like a quaker.

Nope, a group of ten die hard fans have teamed up to make Ocarina of Time 2D, placing the beloved adventure in the classic top-down perspective. This means it will share gameplay elements similar to that of the 8 and 16 bit generations, with hand-drawn cutscenes and a chiptune soundtrack. This remix of the N64 classic is of course a PC-exclusive, which is only about 10% complete at this point. You can actually download a working version that will only really let you play the opening, just check out the description. How badass would it be if this came to a portable like the 3DS? Then again, how badass would it be if Nintendo didn't shut this fan project down? Yeah... I would download that now, before it's gone faster than the Giant's Knife.With the release of Monolith's Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, a trailer for the Season Pass was revealed and you'll gain access to additional story missions, challenge modes, skins and runes; all for only $24.99.The Tolkien estate has also given their blessing to include a one on one fight with Sauron in the game. In the DLC mission called The Bright Lord, you'll assume the role of Celebrimbor as you take on the dark lord. But tackling the Middle-earth lore isn't always so easy. There's a great article on Polygon about how the Tolkien estate lost their shit over the Pumpkins appearing in any games, including this latest one. It has to do with new-world versus old-world crops and some sort of grudge against the gord. Nerds. So that's one payment to rule them all, a Season Pass to bind them, no game to find themselves a pumpkin patch inside them.And finally, I cannot believe I am saying this, but there is another another Assassin's Creed game releasing this year. So that's four fully fledged adventures with Unity, Rogue, Chronicles, and now Identity. Available today in Australia and New Zealand, the iOS iPad developed platformer has you jumping into the boots of a handful of different assassin's as you venture back to Italy and stab people a bunch of people. Now the game has been pegged with an International release date of 2015, but it clearly works and inspite of the game's functionality, it's unfortunately rife with microtransactions. So whether you're speeding up training time for skills, purchasing encrypted items, or premium outfits; it's free-to-play! But they definitely aim to get them dollars out of your account. Will I play this one?

David Pokora and Sanadodeh Nesheiwat broke into various developer studio networks like Microsoft and Zombie Studios, stealing assets valued at over $100 million dollars. Zombie Studios is the developer behind the government funded recruitment game America's Army. One of these genius kids even managed to infiltrate the U.S. military network. If they're found guilty of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and copyright infringement, they face a jail sentence of up to five years. Three other members of the collective have also had charges brought against them, while their partners-in-crime may enjoy some ass pounding prison time. Followed by future employment at the NSA.Speaking of taking it in the butt though, Microsoft would like to make up for all the awful Windows 8 experiences you've had by introducing Windows 10. Yup, somewhere along the way we skipped the Windows 9 experience, which will forever be remembered as the perfect version of Windows, to deliver an experience that is the same across all platforms… Kind of. First the start menu is back, jammed with tiles, but it will definitely tweak that Windows 7 nostalgia. Command prompt will finally let you paste text, store apps behave more like programs, and virtual desktops will finally arrive Windows. While Microsoft has yet to announce an official price or launch date, the technical preview will be opening up this week if you're daring enough to give it a shot. Based on the wording at both the press conference and a quote from Microsoft's Indonesian President, it looks like Windows 8 users will be able to upgrade to 10 for free. No word on Vista or Windows 7 users or games, but let's face it, Microsoft has delivered news this great since they announced the death of the Zune.And while I know we're all a little tired of the constant barrage of Kickstarter projects that have both hindered and helped indie devs, here is a new game you should absolutely consider backing. Battle Chef Brigade is a sort Iron Chef meets Anime, wrapped up in a delicious bounty of promising mechanics, interesting characters, and magic. The Kitchen Arena houses all manner of creatures, which are part of a large ecosystem that can be influenced by the player. Cooking adds more flavor by introducing a levelling system, spells, and specialty tools. Backers should expect Battle Chef Brigade to release on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Sure, consoles would be perfect a platform for the cooking sim, but it looks like the stretch goals won't arrive until the main course is complete. Fingers crossed Chairman Kaga will make an appearance and take a bite out of some crazy ass pepper.Welcome to the news channel BTW, feel free to settle in, kick your feet up and let me know what you think about the banners and icons in the comments.

Readers have been alerting various news outlets that price hikes on the service are taking place in countries like Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, and South Africa. Users in South Africa are specifically showing increases of over 50% on the three-month and annual subscription plans. Don't get me wrong, I've been an advocate for the service for years, but this is really really shitty. Especially since users only received 24 hours notice before the increase happened. Inspite of how awful this is, maybe, just maybe this could be the one thing both Ukraine and Russia can agree on and find common ground. Though it's more likely Putin will just assume control of PlayStation Plus before the end of October. And finally Rovio, the famous studio who made that one game where you throw birds at shit, is going through some restructuring. Laying off as many as 130 of their own employees. The CEO Mikael Hed reports this is due to slower than expected company growth, something that contradicts another article out there. Because I don't know if you heard, but there's an Angry Birds movie coming out and it has basically casted some major comedians to voice the boisterous budgies. Jason Sudeikis, Josh Gad, Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, and Peter Dinklage are just some of the big names rounding out the cast. The film is slated for a July of 2016 release, just in time to become a Summer blockbuster. Now imagine this scenario for a second. You're working on one of the most successful mobile games in history, only to be laid off for reorganization so that Peter Dinklebot can be flung from a slingshot at pigs in a feature length film.

Though it's production is limited to 500 units, providing all parties involved to charge the absurd price of $750. Seriously that's fucking crazy expensive for not even getting a copy of the game.

More specifically something that happened between Intel, Gamasutra, and gender equality in the press.

I'm not going to talk about that, to instead focus on a recent \"victory” for GamerGate that is in my opinion bad for both sides. And before you freak out, just hear me out. Thanks to a highly orchestrated campaign against high-profile press sites like Gamasutra, the GamerGate movement has managed to scare Intel away from advertising on the site. Organizers of the mass protest via email to Intel, expressed their displeasure at Gamasutra championing fair gender representation in games. It worked and in response Intel pulled all their ads. Here's the problem, the only real reason for this activity is to shutdown the voice of the opposition, commonly regarded as the feminist movement. That is not how to win a debate folks. You win by changing hearts and minds of your audience and having a stronger argument than your rivals. I'm all for conversations and think the best thing for both movements would be to keep the communication channels open. But that's my opinion.Now I know this is a sensitive subject and would very much like to hear your opinions in the comments, so be sure to leave some. And please do your best to play nice.I'm Sean and that was Hard News.Hey guys, thanks for not killing me after Hard News.

Yeah me neither… But that hasn't stopped Microsoft from investing more time and money into another bizarre gaming peripheral. Now codenamed RoomAlive, it makes any room into an interactive gaming space. Using multiple projectors and some depth cameras, Microsoft has expanded the gaming space beyond a television. Thanks to the power of Kinect, these devs have created a number of different interactive environments, some of which you will use your body to engage, while others can use traditional control options on a non-traditional surface. This is by no means a commercial product, as the Illumiroom itself was priced at \"thousands of dollars” for the average consumer. There's only one way this could possibly become affordable and that's if the porn industry embraces it. There's no way this could go wrong…Speaking of eye candy, Ubisoft became the subject of controversy in regards to the graphical prowess of their upcoming Assassin's Creed game Unity. Producer Vincent Pontbriand was speaking with Videogamer about developing on PS4/Xbox One and mentioned how they \"decided to lock them at the same specs to avoid all the debates and stuff”. Which immediately sparked a bunch of debates and stuff across the Internet. With PS4 fanboys claimed bullshit for the Xbox One's inability to keep up in the hardware race. Ubisoft first set the record straight by saying that they \"did not lower the specs for Assassin's Creed: Unity to account for any one system over the other,\" but then continued to comment on the story into today noting that the final specs aren't even cemented, despite the game launching in 6 weeks. For AssCreed Black Flag last year, Ubi managed to push the resolution past 900p into 1080p on PS4 using a post launch patch. My two cents on this whole graphical parity war between the next-generation of consoles is… Who the fuck cares so long as the games are fun?Speaking of fun, Super Smash Bros. on 3DS has sold over 2.8 million units worldwide and Nintendo is taking that positive energy from their fanbase and rolling with it. Today they revealed alongside this staggering sales data a number of upcoming release dates for holiday Wii U hits. The rumored launch of Super Smash Bros. on Wii U has been confirmed for November 21st, alongside the launch of the initial twelve amiibo figurines. They also confirmed all the rumored pricing on the Smash controller, Gamecube adaptor and the bundle they previously announced. Lastly, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker has received a price and date. It will launch on December 5th, for the retail price of $39.99 and is expected to support select amiibos as well, by 2015. But that's not all, a second wave of amiibo will arrive in December, adding Zelda, Diddy Kong, Luigi, Little Mac, Pit and Captain Falcon. But no Captain Toad… I suppose Nintendo's having trouble making him look less phallic.Don't forget on today's \"New Game Tuesday” we have Alien: Isolation, NBA 2K15, Driveclub and Costume Quest 2.

Intel issued a statement making clear that they did not mean for it to appear as though they were \"somehow taking sides in an increasingly bitter debate in the gaming community... Intel believes men and women should be treated the same.” But do they believe in the journalistic integrity of the gaming press? They did not comment. Disney has pulled the plug on one of it's first Lucas Films projects less than a year after its inception. Star Wars Tiny Death Star was a clone of the NimbleBit mobile hit Tiny Tower and a fairly well-received one at that. But without informing the developers of the decision, the game was pulled off the app store along with Star Wars: Assault Team. Nimblebit felt it was worth noting that to them, it would be a \"significant source of revenue” disappearing from the pipeline. Users who previously purchased the app will be able to re-download it, but there won't be any future support or purchase options for new users. An inside source from Pocket Gamer claims this is to focus on upcoming releases like the recently launched Star Wars Commander. Which is clearly the only app you're looking for.But some might look to relinquish that which is Disney, like say the biggest name on YouTube? Felix Kjellberg or PewDiePie as you dudes call him, let Icon magazine know in a recent interview that the House of Mouse isn't where his future lies. After purportedly making $4 million a year, the personality says he isn't interested in renewing his contract with Maker this upcoming December. He was previously with Machinima and his experiences with both MCNs have instilled Felix with the desire to become his own YouTube Network. The process may seem daunting, but Felix says he's \"in touch with a couple of people who [I think] would be so right for this,\" And if that doesn't work out, who cares dudes, because Pewds is a millionaire.And finally, a rather explosive situation took place in the city of Plano when Gearbox Software was evacuated late Friday night after a bomb threat. President Randy Pitchford shared some of his experience with us on Twitter, exclaiming that a \"Bomb disposal unit [was] called to Gearbox HQ parking lot to deal with [a] car bomb threat.” Pitchford didn't call in the threat and police aren't disclosing any details on the origin of the threat. But it appears Plano PD felt someone in the office building was in danger, and the police wouldn't allow Randy near his car until a bomb sniffing robot declared it safe. It turns out someone just left Colonial Marines in his car.I'm Sean and THAT was Hard News!Hey thanks for hanging out after Hard News. If you hadn't already, give me a thumbs up and subscribe.

The developers spent a good 20 minutes playing the game and talking about some new additions, including the \"new” 3DS stick nub thing. But the biggest news for Nintendo fans must have been the inclusion of some very interesting crossover items. The first was a partnership with Bandai Namco to feature one of the Taiko Drums from the rhythm arcade franchise as a weapon. Then you have the Sonic Felyne and Animal Crossing Felynes for the sake of variety. But finally the big reveal came when both Samus and Zero-suit Samus were revealed as compatible armor types in the game, complete with a massive Varia cannon! Now sexuality is always a sensitive topic with gamers, so you'd think Capcom would be smart enough not to draw Samus with her ass in my face as she strokes a giant robot dong. But maybe that's just me…What's not just me is the itching sensation that PS4 owners are all getting screwed… Following delay after delay, DRIVECLUB has finally launched, but only the paid version, because PlayStation Plus users don't always get nice things. The glorified demo that is the free version has been held back during launch due to server issues, in order to make sure that paying users received the best experience possible. If you don't know the difference between the free version and the paid version, free users have access to 5 tracks with 11 routes and 10 cars. Paid users have access to 25 tracks with 55 routes and 50 cars. So the game that was supposed to be free-to-play, but would then cost money, is delayed for a third time because of unforeseen server issues and not wanting to upset paying customers. The root of this problem stems from the surprise factor of people actually buying and playing the game. And Sony says the free version will be available whenever they get their shit together.And finally, I was going to congratulate Nintendo for thinking outside the box and letting gamers play a bunch of Wii U games with the upcoming GameCube controller adapter. An idea that would surely usher in a new era for the Wii U and maybe sell a few dozen units. But I can't... Because shortly after a story went live about how it would be \"compatible with all games supported by the Wii U Pro Controller.” That news was quickly redacted a few hours later, as Nintendo removed all statements on the official product page pointing to that feature. They then apologized for the mixup, stating officially \"The GameCube Controller Adapter for Wii U is compatible with Wii U and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U specifically - it is not compatible with any other Wii U software,\" and it \"won't work with the Wii”. Right. But I don't think anyone thought it would, because what could you possible do with eight GameCube controllers plugged into a Wii? And what the fuck is going on over there Nintendo?Let me know what you think is going on in the comments and don't forget to Like and Subscribe.I'm Sean and THAT was Hard News!Thanks for sticking around after Hard News.

PlayStation Now is a streaming service that offers gamers 150 PS3 games to rent over a PS3 and PS4. There hasn't been much positive feedback thus far for the Beta, which has priced its content in a way that doesn't even come close to competing with something like say the used game market or a Steam sale. Yet, Sony's Jack Buser is confident that \"millions” of customers will try the service before it ever leaves Beta and Sony is will be making changes \"based on feedback and usage.\" Expect the service to go live on October 14th, alongside the launch of the PlayStation TV and please be aware PSN will be down for maintenance the day before. FIX FUCKING DRIVECLUB WHILE YOU'RE AT IT!Remember when I mentioned that the Vita had received theme support and how it was stupid? Well it still is, but I guess everyone wants this as the 3DS has also received the ability to also install themes. You can customize your backgrounds, icons, and sound effects; making your 3DS more pretentious than it already is. You get five boring ass color themes for free, but if you'd like something in the vein of Zelda or Mario, it will cost you a couple bucks. Nintendo isn't alone in this trend of silly self-importance as Xbox boss Phil Spencer also confirmed on the Inner Circle Podcast that \"themes and background pics are something that we are [Microsoft is] working on”. Oh and they're going to add screenshot support as well. They look forward to adding these features via a future Xbox One update. Are themes fun? Sure! But I am fairly certain Nintendo and Microsoft have more important things like localizing the \"new” 3DS or trying to make Asian people give a fuck about the Xbox One.And finally, Evolve had it's Big Alpha dated for October 30rd thru November 2nd and it lookswe will all have a chance to engage in some fierce multiplayer action. The 4v1 competitive shooter will be dominating Halloween weekend across all platforms and will most likely consume Twitch, as 2K is planning to let everyone stream, capture and generally go crazy without having to worry about a flag. They also let us know that the pre-order bonus will be for the fourth playable monster, with the third not yet revealed. I'm hoping that the next one is Nessie, but I ain't given it no tree fifty. Want to shoot me in my stupid face? Well today is your lucky day Internet!

Many sources who work with CNET news mention the company has been courting prospective buyers and may be interested in a parent company infusing some capital into their already successful technology platform. But is this the best thing for gamers? I am not so sure. Most of the prospective buyers, like say Google, probably have some sort of vested interest in the gaming community. Unity has succeeded not only because of the simplicity of its tool kit, but because it works on everything. And I mean everything from PlayStation to Xbox to Nintendo; ALL platforms support Unity. Especially mobile which has been a huge successful for the engine maker. Whatever happens, here's hoping it won't affect the launch of a mystery ScrewAttack Games project.    In other news, Bungie just can't seem to get these Destiny events right. There are ongoing issues with Loot Cave exploits and then there was the whole Queen's Bounty stuff. Now the recently launched Iron Banner has become the laughing stock of the entire community. Originally the idea was to provide PVP combat without level restrictions, so legendary gear could realize its full-potential and dominate all you lower-level plebes. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be working and even some level threes are dominating whole PVP matches. Additionally, common weapons seem to be just as powerful as exotics, which frankly defeats the entire point of this event. Then you have rep points only being distributed if you win, unlike normal PVP in the Crucible. Leading to some rage quit from matches rather than get nothing. Now I'm sympathetic towards Bungie as a fan of the game, but this was something that should've been worked out in the Beta testing process, where they previously introduced the Iron Banner. That's why you test things so they aren't this fucked up at launch! God I'm glad I'm not paying a monthly subscription to play this game.    And finally, it's Friday, so let's have a look at the upcoming digital smorgasbord that is the Nintendo eShop. The witching hour is nearly upon us as we prepare for the October 24th launch and the demo for Bayonetta 2 is now available in North America and Europe. If you for some reason are a non-believer, be sure to watch the latest trailer on Nintendo's channel. As a franchise fanboy, it gave me chills. You also have a sequel to that PAC-MAN game no one really likes launching on the 14th for Wii U and 3DS, some deep discount on Indie Games thanks to IndieCade 2014, I recommend you take advantage of Guacamelee for under $10 and Castlevania: Circle of the Moon is available on Virtual Console, but that isn't all as the other two Castlevania GBA games were dated for next week. So before all hallow's eve you can get your hands on Harmony of Dissonance and Aria of Sorrow thanks to Virtual Console. Kind of makes me want to hide my candy in a wall this year and make the kids whip it. Either way it should work out better than last years candy in a van idea…    I'm Sean and That was Hard News.","length":209,"original_air_date":"2014-10-10T14:58:00.000Z","channel_id":"92b6bb21-91d2-4b1b-bf95-3268fa0d9939","channel_slug":"rooster-teeth","season_id":"ffa2901d-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","season_slug":"hard-news-season-1","season_number":1,"show_title":"Hard News","show_id":"ff932b21-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","show_slug":"hard-news","is_sponsors_only":false},"uuid":"00173bb3-464e-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","archive":{"id":"roosterteeth-7008","status":"archived","files":[{"name":"2014-10-10_Destiny_Breaks_Iron_Banner_Unity_Looking_for_Buyer_Nintendo_eShop_Offerings__Hard_News_101014_[7008].description","filesize":3213,"file_ext":"description","md5":"5335ad5646a8edeb6f4dcc774c4b5e6f"},{"name":"2014-10-10_Destiny_Breaks_Iron_Banner_Unity_Looking_for_Buyer_Nintendo_eShop_Offerings__Hard_News_101014_[7008].info.json","filesize":23234,"file_ext":"json","md5":"c4137a6506bc4cf2df5bbf50e652d757"},{"name":"2014-10-10_Destiny_Breaks_Iron_Banner_Unity_Looking_for_Buyer_Nintendo_eShop_Offerings__Hard_News_101014_[7008].jpg","filesize":112442,"file_ext":"jpg","md5":"4339f9591e1e10d83b2e8ef25d1e299b"},{"name":"2014-10-10_Destiny_Breaks_Iron_Banner_Unity_Looking_for_Buyer_Nintendo_eShop_Offerings__Hard_News_101014_[7008].mp4","filesize":109911668,"file_ext":"mp4","md5":"0ef147e6a54b81590268d60cff5b666b"}]}},{"id":7009,"type":"episode","attributes":{"title":"GamerGate Death Threats, October is DK Month, Resident Evil Reveals | Hard News 10/13/14","slug":"gamergate-death-threats-october-is-dk-month-resident-evil-reveals-hard-news-101314","number":0,"description":"I'm Sean Hinz and this is Hard News for Monday, October 13, 2014.We might be reaching the halfway point of October, but that hasn't stopped Nintendo from declaring it the Month of Donkey Kong. After the Year of Luigi, we thought the Year of Yoshi would be a sure bet. I mean, Dinosaurs are fucking awesome?! But nope, Nintendo is all about giant apes, as DK and the crew are going to be taking over Virtual Console on Wii U and 3DS. Every Thursday for the next three weeks, one installment of the SNES Donkey Kong Country Trilogy comes to Wii U and one installment in the GB Donkey Kong Land Trilogy comes to 3DS. In order to tie the whole promotion together, both Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze and Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D are discounted 33%, so long as you buy one of the Virtual Console games on their respective platforms. Of course there's a catch though, as this promotion appears to be a European exclusive, so us Americans are shit out-of-luck. How appropriate that Nintendo tease us with a treat, to only trick us moments later.Speaking of Halloween, the weekend held a bunch of news surrounding the Resident Evil franchise, some of it official and some not-so-much. Let's start with the official news out of NYCC, where producer Michiteru Okabe revealed that the PlayStation versions of Resident Evil Revelations 2 would be gaining access to exclusive content. A pre-order for PS3 or PS4 would net players access to the Raid Mode Throwback Pack. It's a collection of stages from previous Resident Evil titles that players can run to earn additional BP, loot, and experience. No word on a bonus for any of the Microsoft platforms. Then you have a rumor coming out of Variety pointing to a German company producing a spin-off TV series for the franchise. Constantin Film has been transitioning more towards television these past few years and right after they release a show called Mortal Instruments and a movie called Perfume, they will be delivering the Umbrella Corporation to living rooms around the world. Good thing The Walking Dead will be finished before Resident Evil launches, I can only really deal with one zombie show in my life.And finally, we're back to another #GamerGate story. Developer of Revolution 60 and a vocal opponent of the movement, Brianna Wu was unfortunately a victim of doxxing this weekend. After retweeting some memes from her fans poking fun at #GamerGate, Brianna's personal information was posted online, including her home address, which lead people who may or may not have been part of the movement to threaten her and her family with acts of violence and rape. She reached out to local police and on their advice she is no longer at her home address. Additionally, Wu may have evidence that her company's financial accounts are being tampered with and the FBI is investigating. Regardless of which side of the fence you're on when it comes to the ethics of games journalism, it is universally understood that this sort of behavior is unacceptable. I hope the guilty are brought to swift justice and this game dev and her family can go home safe.I'm Sean and THAT was Hard News.Whew! That was an intense Hard News today. How about a nice palate cleanse with a little bit of Death Battle? We've posted the fight preview for the combatant Ryu from Street Fighter as he prepares for his battle with Mortal Kombat's Scorpion.

This past Wednesday, four men in Reading, PA were caught with over $100,000 in yo thanks to a sting operation from a federal agent. Apparently the feds knew the Xbox being shipped to Yefries Herrera had some sort of illegal substance in it and once he signed for it, his fate was sealed. After receiving the goods, agents followed Herrera to a drop point, catching three other people in the act. Now everyone will probably go to ass pounding prison and that gaming console will never bring joy to the hearts of children again. Instead it will live out the rest of its years in an evidence bag. You drug dealers are monsters!Speaking of monsters, THQ apparently locked of one of their failed science projects and it is just now seeing the light of day thanks to Unseen64.net. In development around 2010, Saints Row: The Cooler was a motion-controlled brawler being developed by Heavy Iron Studios. This same team went on to make UFC Personal Trainer. The name was a reference to your role as a bouncer who would go to various bars in the Saints Row universe and \"cool off” the situation by beating the fuck out of people. Combat consisted of timing attacks in front of a Kinect sensor or using a PS Move, while in first-person. It only had six months in the oven before THQ pulled the plug and frankly, that was a smart move considering where the company was heading. Could have spent that money on Darksiders 3 you asshats!And lastly, PlayStation is kind of fucking about again, as the PlaySTation TV launched with a few issues. First a couple compatible games with the micro console have mysteriously been removed from the official list of games and they of course do not work. Most are PSP, PS One Classics and a couple minis including; Valkyria Chronicles 2, Metal Gear Solid, Silent Hill, and a few more. Luckily Killzone Mercenary will work after the launch day patch, unlike Netflix, which will probably need a patch of it's own. For whatever reason the App says it isn't compatible with the PlayStation TV, despite the device touting the opposite. But this sort of philandering is common for Sony, who also revealed that Gran Turismo 7 will be delayed into 2015 or 2016. Previously Polyphony Digital studio head Kazunori Yamauchi said the game was coming in 2014, but in an interview with GamesTM mentioned it now looks like another year or two. Why stop there though? How about 2017 or 18? Maybe we can wait for 2020 and capitalize on the new decade?!!

The threat of terrorism at Utah State University has lead Anita Sarkeesian to cancel an upcoming speaking event and turned the Internet into another battle ground. The Standard Examiner reports that USU officials received and threatening email on Tuesday stating, and I quote, \"\"If you do not cancel her talk, a Montreal Massacre style attack will be carried out against the attendees”. The awful individual behind this, claimed they would use a \"\"semi-automatic rifle, multiple pistols and a collection of pipe bombs” to punish those who would support the \"\"toxic influence of feminism”. Their words, not mine. They also say they are a student currently attending Utah State and we'd only know their identity if USU officials allowed the massacre to happen. Anita Sarkeesian chose to cancel the lecture, because the University refused to allow pat downs, provide metal detectors, or ban concealed weapons. There were some security precautions taking place, but not enough for Sarkeesian to feel safe or feel her audience would be. With no specific mention of the GamerGate, it is interesting that much of the media has picked this story up as being associated with the movement. It should be worth noting that looking through the mainstream press, GamerGate as a gender war is quickly overshadowing GamerGate as a critique of gaming journalism ethics.  Fuck this noise, let's talk video games! Killer Instinct: Season 2 is launching today and Ultratech has been fast a work building new combatants for Jago and Orchid to battle. Immediately players gain access to TJ Combo and Maya, two classic KI fighters who're re-imagined for the latest installment. Then over the next six months, one character per month will be added to the roster. So far we've only seen their silhouettes, so let's to name the unrevealed characters. You have Laser Mummy, Riptor, Mystery Ghost-Dude, Treebeard, One-eyed Ninja, and Cinder. Additionally there have been balance changes, enhanced combos and a new progression system. Oh and the resolution has been bumped up to 900P, so all you graphics whores can suck it. The $40 Ultra Edition comes with all eight characters, 16 accessories, 8 costumes, and Killer Instinct 2 the arcade version, ported to Xbox One. The $20 Combo Breaker pack just comes with the characters. It's a great time for KI and stay tuned for our take on Season 2 later this week.  And lastly, a Magic The Gathering collector on the YouTube channel OpenBoosters has managed to win what many might consider the Geek Lottery. The guy behind the video got his hands on a Alpha Starter deck from the origin days of Magic and as luck would have it one of legendary Power of the Nine cards was inside. The Power of the Nine was a set of cards that are considered the most powerful from the glory days. The card found was a Black Lotus, one of the rarest cards from the Alpha and Beta decks. Only 4400 were printed, 1100 of which came from the Alpha deck, making this Black Lotus extremely valuable. So valuable that the last one was auctioned off for a whopping $27,000 last year. Holy shit! You could by a sweet ass sports car or put a down payment on a house. My only advice to you would be that if beanie babies or Pokemon cards have taught me anything, you sell that shit right now. Speaking of which, I have about a thousand beanie babies in a box somewhere if you want to buy some.  I'm Sean Hinz and that was Hard News.  Have you checked out the ScrewAttack Live channel yet?

I wanted to start with a new feature here on Hard News, the Wii U Digital Round-up.Once a week Nintendo let's us know about the big things happening on the eShop and I just want to highlight some of the good you can get from it. Consider it penance from yesterday. Today we have great news, as Castlevania is haunting the Virtual Console launching Castlevania: Dracula X from the SNES and Castlevania: Circle of the Moon from the GBA. They'll each arrive on October 9th, reminding us of why we love the franchise so much. Fingers crossed for Aria of Sorrow one day, so Soma Cruz and I can tear up Dracula's castle again.    But that isn't the only upcoming Digital Content to look forward too. Mario Kart 8's upcoming DLC is bringing the B Dasher back for Mario Kart DS, along with with the Blue Falcon. The content is a little over a month away and I cannot fucking wait to get my hands on the new karts. The two expansions are $8 individually or $12 as a bundle and the first goes live in November.    Blizzard has declared that it's time to bring out the dead and undelete the denizens of Warcraft. Thanks to a built-in feature coming in the next patch, users will be able to resurrect their long dead characters, retaining their enchantments, gems, and items. Of course there are rules to this process and not every corpse is eligible for reanimation. Specifically any under level 10 or over level 50, and basically anyone deleted more than 120 days ago. Though levels 10-30 will only get 90 days of death. Oh and you only get this option once per month. Awfully nice of Blizzard to go all necromancer on your account, but maybe this is in response to the wave of users who lost faith after the cancellation of Titan. Wait, don't go, Blizzard won't let you down!    Speaking of not letting us down, Nintendo has been kind enough to bundle up everything you'll need in order to get the most out of Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. But wait, didn't we know about this already… Well I guess Kotaku reported they saw the box art on Amazon and thought, hey! this is a non-story story. So thanks for that Stephen! While we're here, I might as well remind you Nintendo is bundling the Smash controller, with the adapter and a copy of the game for $99. Which is… not really a great discount… $60 for the game, $30 for the controller, and $20 for the adapter. I guess it saves you $10, for something you intend to buy anyway. It would be great if Nintendo bundled a limited edition controller with the game to entice me a bit more. I am sure the guy who designed the 60 3DS colors could find the time in his busy schedule to make a Gamecube controller.    That's a wrap for the week, thanks for being here and don't forget to subscribe to the new YouTube channel.    I'm Sean and that was Hard News.    Thanks for sticking around after Hard News. We'll be streaming remotely today on Screwin' Around and it's more high-level Destiny play.

I accidentally slid in some b-roll from the AvP game developed in 2010, but GOG was actually giving away AvP from 1999. Sorry if anyone felt misled. Now I know you g1s might be busy with all those free games available this weekend, but ESPN wants you to tune into the League of Legends World Championships if you have some free time. Despite their lack of faith in games as a \"real sport”, ESPN 3 will be showing the finals at 1:30 AM CST this Sunday. The broadcast is live from South Korea as 40,000 people come out to watch Samsung White battle Star Horn Royal Club for a prize pool valued at over a million dollars. Not a bad way to make a living.In more international gaming news, the Irish postal service has issued a new line of licensed stamps that feature some of gaming's greatest icons. \"Designed by Zinc Design Consultants, the Dublin-based award-winning graphic design studio”, the stamp sheet features iconic characters like Mario, Sonic, Space Invaders, and Pac-Man. The Irish post says the line is meant to pay homage to the \"iconic status of the games and the transition of gaming from novelty to global industry.” While the stamps won't count as legal postage in the US, you can pick a sheet up for your collection for only a few Euros. Just click the link in the description.And finally, I will throw my two cents in the ring on the recent controversy over the game Hatred. Developed by Polish studio Destructive Creations, Hatred appears to be a simulation of a civilian massacre in an isometric setting. It's origins seem rooted in the reality that society is continuing to evolve into a more polite and politically correct culture and CEO Jaros?aw Zieli?ski wanted he and his team \"to create something against trends. Something different, something that could give the player a pure gaming pleasure.” A statement that says a lot about human nature when pleasure is defined as committing what is essentially genocide against a population of unarmed NPCs. Destructive Creation's response to such a claim seems to be \"don't take it too seriously, it's just a game.” But Epic Games has expressed their displeasure in the project by requesting their Unreal logo be removed from all marketing. Having only seen the first trailer, I can understand where Epic is coming from.While it would hypocritical of me to wag my finger at a company over violence in gaming, the anti-hero's opening monologue speaks volumes about the tone of this game. What will most certainly garner the project the most attention, will also make gaming into a scapegoat for real-world issues. And for what? So we could kill defenseless NPCs and ill-equipped police officers? There's little sport in that. While I have easily spent 40 hours this past month killing various life-forms in Destiny, I am at least motivated by and idea that is positive, despite my path to victory being lined with the dead. Is Hatred a bad game? No one really knows yet, but the message it sends to people who exist on the fringe of the gaming world is that we're a collection of emotionally damaged sociopaths, who're out looking for vengeance against an inexplicable wrong committed against us. Considering how the mainstream media has dealt with the Anita Sarkeesian lecture from earlier this week, this seems like the wrong message to be sending right now.Man this has been a rough week for games, so thanks for sticking it out with me.

I hope you don't have plans for this weekend, because Steam and Good Old Games want you to play some games for free. Really, they're completely free! GOG is is offering a copy of Alien versus Predator from Rebellion to anyone who signs up for the Good Old Games Galaxy beta. Galaxy is the Steam-like online gaming platform from the distribution service that offers DRM free multiplayer support for the GOG library. This version of AvP includes all DLC and Xbox 360 controller support, all for free. Click the link in the description to sign up. And if you still have more free time, Steam will be unlocking 10 games at noon tomorrow and setting them to free play all weekend. Highlights include Awesomenauts, Injustice, Don't Starve, PayDay 2, XCOM and of course more. PC master race indeed!    But Microsoft wants to make the Xbox One the envy of all you WASD nerds, by bringing super useful features to the October patch. You have a more robust snap feature, additional sharing options, a new media player app which supports MKV and DNLA, stronger TV integration and a few tweaks here and there. But the feature I'm most looking forward to is the Xbox One's ability to help you find your controller, using the power of Kinect. The only catch is, the controller would have to be on first, so from now on only power your Xbone up using the controller. Then if you take a bong rip and manage to immediately lose said controller, all you need to do is yell at your Kinect \"\"find” and it will vibrate your controller for you. It seems like a great feature for stoners and potentially encourages healthy marriages. For example, tonight my wife and I are going to have an orgy with the Xbox One, as we attempt to find her G spot by screaming \"\"find” at the TV.    And finally, Google continues to expand its empire with the reveal of their first microconsole, the Nexus Player. Let's cut to the chase, this is basically a Fire TV, but developed by Google and without the aid of the venerable Gary Busey. The hardware specs are fairly similar... with 1.8 GHz quad-core, 8GB of storage, WiFi, Bluetooth, and 1GB of RAM; half the RAM of a Fire TV. It comes packed with a remote for $99 and the ASUS game controller is sold separately for $40. The operating system on the device is another Android platform designed specifically for the Nexus Player called Android TV. Big surprise. Pre-orders open tomorrow and you can scoop one up on November 3rd. And of course like every other microconsole it will support Apps like YouTube, HuluPlus, Netflix, and blah blah blah blah. Look! We don't need anymore fucking microconsoles… We have like six of these things and they're all the same. I swear to god if Apple launches one I'll burn this whole fucking place to the ground.    \"\"Hey Sean, we just bought a PlayStation TV!”    Awesome!

The Final Fantasy event in Vegas was called Fan Fest, not Fan Expo. AND the city-state in A Realm Reborn's upcoming expansion is Ishgard, not that failed Warren Beatty film from the 80's.Anyway, everyone's favorite arcade shoot ‘em up Time Crisis is returning to Japanese arcades in 2015 and they aim to freshen up the formula. Traditionally the franchise has used a pedal to move in and out of cover, but Time Crisis 5 now has TWO PEDALS! Providing users the option of flanking enemies and taking ownership of their path to victory. The cabinet itself sports two 55-inch monitors and a redesigned GunCon that allows players to cycle through weapons. By the time Time Crisis 5 launches in March of 2015, we'll be one year away from the franchises 20th anniversary, where it started back in 1996. Looking at the flier for the upcoming arcade release, this game must be about time travel. Why else would there be a backwards cap having douchebag in a sleeveless t-shirt if he wasn't from 1996? I love you Japan.In more serious news, the fighting game community has rallied in support of a recently deceased KI pro's family. Terrance Moore, or PushaTee as the community knew him, was competing in the The Runback weekly tournament series hosted by Level Up when he collapsed at the event last week. Paramedics quickly arrived and immediately took Terrance to the ER, but were unfortunately unable to save him. Terrance was only 29 and is survived by a wife and two children. Now a few days later the community has truly come together by launching numerous donation campaigns to help the family afford a funeral, which can run as high as $10,000 over here in the states. The response has been incredible and fundraisers from r/Kappa and SuperArcade have already managed to raise nearly $15,000! Our condolences go out to his family and if you'd like to donate we've posted links in the description.And lastly, an indie developer is learning that death threats won't help you get your way. FPS Paranautical Activity recently moved from Early Access to the real deal on Steam, but the transition was a rather bumpy one. When the game when live for purchase, it had the \"Now Available in Early Access” tagline on the frontpage banner. Creator Mike Maulbeck was none too pleased and expressed his frustration on social media with the all caps phrase. \"ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME STEAM? WE JUST RELEASED OUT OF EARLY ACCESS AND THIS IS OUR FRONT PAGE BANNER?” Sure, with all the negative stigma associated with that aspect of Steam, I can understand his frustration, but the need to vent went too far when he tweeted… \"I am going to kill gabe newell. He is going to die.” A tweet he later deleted, but not soon enough, because Valve reached out to Maulbeck to let him know his game would no longer be available on Steam due to him issuing a death threat on social media. In Valve's own words \"Death threats cross a line.” An idea I think we should all remember the next time we're upset about something on the Internet.Don't forget to like, share, and subscribe.I'm Sean and that was Hard News!Another Hard News in the bag and our Live channel did something a little different last night.

If you aren't already playing Final Fantasy XIV Online, Square Enix would like you to know there is an expansion in the works for the reborn MMO and it has a Spring of 2015 release date. The expansion was revealed as Heavensward at the Final Fantasy XIV Fan Expo in Vegas over the weekend. We had a glimpse of the content coming with it in a snowy reveal trailer, but info is kind of sparse at this point. All we really know is it takes place in the city-state of Ishtar, features a new race, jobs, primals, end game content and a level bump up to 60. Expect more details to arrive during the London Fan Festival on October 25 and Tokyo Fan Fest in November. As a fan of the franchise, the trailer has some sweet ass dragoons with transforming armor that I really want to play as. Seriously, all I wanna do is fucking slay dragons with my badass jump ability. Then I remember this game has a monthly fee and nope the fuck out.  What you won't be able to quit is making bread into toast. It can truly become an epic adventure sometimes and Bossa Studios is looking to capitalize on our harrowing exploits in the new game I am Bread. A bread slice simulation which will have you wielding a knife as you skateboard around the house and do laundry. But how would you control said piece of bread you might ask? By manipulating the corners of course. Each button is assigned a different corner on the bread which will have you flipping and dragging your slice around the house. Along the way you'll probably end up decreasing your Edibility meter as you sop up everything in your path, making for a rather disgusting French Toast. And your Deliciousness meter will likely represent some sort of overall score. Right now it looks like white bread is the only playable character, but I'm looking forward to some more colorful protagonists like jewish rye, honey cornbread, or crusty sourdough.  And finally, a bunch of news leaked about the Wii U version of Super Smash Bros. thanks to Amazon. First, a rumored board game mode may bring the joy of Mario Party to Smash. The product description reads \"\"whether you're creating stages on the GamePad, competing in challenges crafted by Master Hand and Crazy Hand, or outwitting your opponents in a brand new board game mode, there's no doubt that the ultimate Smash Bros. game has arrived.” Sakurai has promised to explain in details even more Master Hand and Crazy Hand content prior to the game's release and teased two new modes in a Miiverse post earlier this month. There was an additional audio leak from the 3DS version that basically confirmed those modes. I expect all these rumors will be confirmed in the Smash exclusive Nintendo Direct set to air this Thursday at 5 PM CST or we could get one where they talk about the crap we already know.   I'm Sean and THAT was Hard News.

Respawn is working on a new mode for Titanfall and it might actually get you back into the game. Called Frontier Defense, the new mode introduces four player co-op to the multiplayer shooter as you battle of hordes of AI-controlled grunts, spectres, and titans. The mode will also encourage you to engage in new strategies, like placing turrets, setting Titan drop points, and even taking sniping from the drop ship. The mode places towers in existing maps which you must defend from hordes of enemies and some of the AI are variants on their standard loadouts. This new content is part of a free update and while we don't have any specific dates at this time, it will be bundle with some other changes like Marked for Death Pro mode, Deadly Ground mode, new ranked play, and other various improvements. How disheartening must it be to look at Activision launching hits like Destiny and Call of Duty, while EA is hoping you won't ask about Battlefield as they try to keep a March release relevant?    Speaking of relevance, Warner Bros. wants to keep the live-action Mortal Kombat brand alive and kicking, by tying it into the upcoming release of Mortal Kombat X. This move shouldn't come as a big surprise as the previous seasons of Mortal Kombat: Legacy have been positively received and did big things for Machinima and the franchise as a whole. With that in mind, WBIE's newest division Blue Ribbon Content, will be producing the series in order to \"\"feature some of the franchise's most iconic characters as well as a new generation of fighters.\"\" There are no dates or really any details on the project at this time, but Mortal Kombat X has an April 14th of 2015 release date across all platforms. Hopefully the live-action series won't be far behind, but until then fingers crossed there's a scene where Jeri Ryan and Casper Van Dien take Cassie Cage to Gymboree.    And lastly, an idiot from Florida has filed a Change.org petition demanding that Super Smash Bros. be ported to the PlayStation Vita. I'm not kidding… In the petition, David Smith eloquently notes how \"\"Nintendo NEEDS to port this game to the PSVita. [Because] many of us Sony fans don't want to buy an underpowered console like the Nintendo 3DS”. He then furthers his case with the notion that this is probably \"\"REQUIRED by US anititrust law, since Nintendo has a monopoly on games like Smash Bros. by virtue of having no competing title.” First off, fuck you for saying the 3DS is underpowered. I don't know where your expectations lie for portable gaming, but I don't feel the graphical prowess is all that inferior to Vita. In fact, the only truly superior aspect of having dual analog sticks will be rendered null and void when the new 3DS comes stateside. Secondly, \"\"no competing title”, really? REALLY DAVID?! Have you truly forgotten PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale came out for the platform nearly two years ago? A game which is clearly a Smash clone, and it ain't half bad if you aren't a complete nitwit. Honestly David Smith, you are one of the worst Vita owners on the planet and bring shame to all of us.

You want to share your excitement with everyone and hey, I bet the company wants you to as well. Unless you leak some proprietary information within hours of your first day on the job. Like eSports coach Michael Cavanaugh who posted a picture on social media that may or may not have leaked the launch date for Halo 5. In a picture on Twitter, Michael says he is \"extremely happy and humbled to join the the 343 Industries team to work on @Halo 5: Guardians!” But look closely behind him and notice countdown clock with 382 days left in a project. If that is for Halo 5: Guardians, it would put launch on Tuesday, November 10th of 2015. Not all that surprising considering everything we know about the franchise and when it has launched historically. The tweet is still up, so maybe that 343 Industries doesn't much care, but man what a newb! Will someone please just go teabag Michael on Vine for me?In a time long before social media, a company existed called 3D Realms and they once made great games like Duke Nukem, Commander Keen, and many many other classic franchises. Then in 2009 they closed up shop, but that wouldn't be the end of their story. Recently, Interceptor Entertainment CEO Fredrik Schrieber and investor Mike Nielsen came together and purchased the developer, along with its intellectual properties and after getting their house in order, they're starting off with a bang! Yesterday, 3D Realms launched 3D Realms Anthology, a collection of 32 games from yesteryear, updated to run on modern PCs in an exclusive launcher and is completely DRM-free. It comes bundled with the \"re-rockestrated soundtrack” courtesy of Interceptor's Andrew Hulshult and for the next 12 hours or so is half-price or $20. While there are many games in the collection to be excited for, I look forward to jumping into Blake Stone's boots and killing all manner of aliens once again. It's kind of funny how games are at their core the same after 20 years time.And finally, the moment you're all here for, let's talk Smash. Yesterday evening Nintendo held a very special Nintendo Direct dedicated to 50 facts relating to the Wii U version of Smash. I am not going to hit all 50, you can watch it yourself in the description. What I will do is pull out some of the highlights. To start, thanks to the Wii U's superior power over the 3DS, Smash will have modes that can feature as many as eight fighters on screen at once. It's a first for the franchise and will have some giant stages to accommodate that many combatants on the screen. Next, custom stages are confirmed and will allow users to be more creative thanks to the Gamepad. There were a metric shit-ton of modes introduced like Coin Battle, Stamina Matches, Event Mode, and the Smash Tour. That's the boardgame-like mode that will have you and three friends battling for supremacy. Additionally you have refined trophies, a cool music player, extensive UI customization, brief fighter movies, and even more characters. Like Ridley, who is a stage boss in the Pyrosphere and Mew-Two, who'll be returning as a fighter thanks to DLC in spring of 2015. The catch is you'll have to own both the 3DS and Wii U version to get him. Clever girl… Altogether it was a great look at the strengths of the home console version and frankly, this looks to be the biggest game yet from Nintendo.

It runs in glorious 720p on the Xbox 360 and weighs in at a hefty 2GB for anyone worried about hard-drive space. The limited number of people covering the launch all seem pretty happy with their purchase, mostly due to it only costing $3.74 here in North America. That's actually cheaper than the $3.99 it costs on most mobile devices. It comes jam packed with achievements and some speculate this might in fact be a port of the mobile port. No word on whether or not this will come to PS3, but you can still pick it up as a PS2 classic if you Sony ponies don't want to feel left out. Oh and there hasn't been confirmation of any sort of hot beverages coming to the Xbox Live version... So go back to your visual novels and dating sims you pervs.Speaking of watching other people play, the PS4 Share Play feature introduced in their first presser will finally arrive as of patch 2.0 launching tomorrow. If you forget, Share Play provides users the ability to let their friends join their gaming sessions virtually. Kind of like sharing your desktop on Skype, but with a few fun features. All you have to do is create a party and jump into a game. Once you're ready, hit the Share button and there is a new option of allowing your friends one hour of Share Play time in a particular session. From there they can watch your game, jump into some local co-op remotely as a second player, or even be passed the controller to take control of the game altogether. The best part is most of the features only require the host PS4 to have a PlayStation Plus account and copy of the game. Your friends only need PlayStation Plus for local co-op remotely. There is one caveat, you can only enable a Share Play session for an hour at a time, assumably to keep people from just streaming games to their friends. Never-the-less, it's a pretty cool feature and it's basically free. So let's bitch about it, am I right?!And if you don't already own an Xbox One, now's the time. Starting November 2nd, every single Xbox One is being discounted by $50 and that includes the bundles. So let's breakdown all the options. You have the Kinect-less bundles like AssCreed, Call of Duty, and Sunset Overdrive. Now AssCreed includes Black Flag and Unity, Call of Duty is a custom console, controller, game and 1 TB HDD and Sunset Overdrive is a white Xbone with the game. Each is priced at $350 now, with the Call of Duty being $450 because of the Hard Drive. Now if you're willing to drop $450 on an Xbox One and you want a Kinect, I recommend the AssCreed bundle with Kinect. Not only does it include both Black Flag and Unity, but since you bought a Kinect, Microsoft is going to throw in the new Dance Central Spotlight. This promotion runs until January 3rd and pretty much every big box retailer is participating. Considering my Best Buy warranty let's me swap a broken console for a new one at no additional charge, something I did FOUR times with my 360, I will be running the bastard for a week straight with all the exhaust ports covered. New Xbone incoming!Don't forget to like, share, and subscribe.I'm Sean and THAT was Hard News!If you hadn't already taken a second to check out the latest trailer from our upcoming release Disorder, the live-action trailer went up last Friday on YouTube. GameInformer says that \"despite its rudimentary visuals, [Disorder] deals with weighty subjects”, because a kid suffering from schizophrenia couldn't possibly be a lighthearted romp through Candyland.

The expected list of games is extensive and is set to include roughly 30 DRM-free classics, six of which have released as of today. Those releases are Secret of Monkey Island, KOTOR, Star Wars: X-Wing & Tie Fighter Special Editions, Sam & Max Hit The Road, and Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis. Most are priced at $10, some with a 20% discount, and Fate of Atlantis and Sam and Max are only $6. Obviously we?re all very excited for X-Wing and Tie Fighter, but with another two-dozen games waiting in the wind, you shouldn?t go blowing all your bison dollars just yet. Fingers crossed Armed and Dangerous will be coming to GOG alongside the other two-dozen Star Wars games we?re sure to get. Disney is certainly taking great care with George Lucas? franchise, by shoving it down your throat, any which way they can.Onto more pressing matters. Twitch has taken a stance on the significance of sexy streaming across its platforms and basically enacted a no tolerance policy. In an update to their Rules of Conduct, the streaming giant has decided that ?wearing no clothing or sexually suggestive clothing - including lingerie, swimsuits, pasties, and undergarments ? is prohibited, as well as any full nude torsos, which applies to both male and female broadcasters.? Critics within the community have felt, much like Twitch, that the practice has been a distraction from the services purpose of watching other people play games. One of the first victims of this new rule is Rooster Teeth?s Meg Turney, who according to GamerHeadlines.com was hit with a warning over her profile banner showcasing Meg in a bra. She?s taking it in stride though with the hashtag TooHotForTwitch and her updated profile to censor the panties. I guess this means we?ll have to re-think tonight?s stream.And while we?re on the subject of scantily clad gamers, Playboy has partnered with Nintendo all companies to help promote the launch of Bayonetta 2 here in North America. In a move that has to be a first for the publisher, the iconic character of Bayonetta is being cosplayed by Playmate Pamela Horton, Playboy?s resident Gamer Next Door. While it certainly lacks the usual tact Nintendo is known for in its gaming promotion, you can?t deny that a large part of what makes Bayonetta who she is goes back to sex appeal. Unfortunately for all of us perverts out there, the photo shoot leaves plenty to the imagination, though it isn?t like we haven?t already seen Pamela in her birthday suit. Should you be bold enough, there?s a gallery on Facebook right now where you can vote on the sexiest of the 9 available pictures and share with your friends. But I for one cannot get over how weird Pamela looks due to only being 5 foot 6, while Bayonetta is clearly 8 feet tall and all legs. Seriously, she is giant!Oh and let me know how the new redesign is working for you? We did this to match our dot com new look, which you can check out right now this logo to my left. I?m Sean and THAT was Hard News. What sort of bizarro world are we living in here guys? Twitch is getting all classy on us while Nintendo is working with naked models?

So Xbox 360 owners and PS3 owners will no longer be getting the open-world zombie parkour they?ve been holding out for. In a Facebook post the company let it be known that they ?have no choice but to leave past-gen systems behind and release Dying Light exclusively on the next-gen consoles and PC. Put simply, older consoles just couldn?t run the game?. I can?t imagine WBIE was happy with the news, but when you look at the concessions being made in games like Shadow of Mordor or WWE 2K15, the experience is certainly diminished by the dated hardware. Unfortunately for Techland, I don?t really think anyone was going to buy a next-gen console to play that game, so their sales probably dropped significantly. OOoooo? Another zombie game! Can?t find those anywhere. Happy Halloween!But while we?re talking about the undead, Destiny is getting in the holiday spirit with a bunch of themed items. The Jackolyte and Flight of Shadows are consumables dropped by the Hive which affect the look of your helm and respawn. All guardians should have a package waiting for them at the postmaster with a few Jackolytes. There?ll also be a new sparrow in one of four colors that features a sweet Guy Fieri paint job and the ability to roll. All these additions came free in a patch, unlike the upcoming expansion. Bungie confirmed today that the first expansion called The Dark Below will arrive on December 9th across all platforms and bring with it a bump in the light level cap, five additional bounty slots, and more gear. From a gameplay perspective there will be three story missions which add to your light, three Crucible maps, a new strike, a second PlayStation exclusive strike, and the long-awaited Raid against Crota featuring the Hive. The expansions are $20 individually or $35 together, with the second expansion in early 2015. To be honest, I expected a bit more for my Andrew Jackson, but then again, I?d expect Raid armor to drop when I run the Raid. What do you say to that Bungie?And finally, Nintendo has done the unthinkable. No, I?m talking about the recent team up with Playboy, because in the past six months, Nintendo has actually managed to turn a profit. How is this possible you may ask? Was it the success of Mario Kart 8? Or Hyrule Warriors? Or one of the 7,000 3DS versions they?ve released? Well, those may have played a big part in getting there, the deciding factor ended up coming from the depreciation of the yen and some positive exchange gains. The company remains well short of their Wii U hardware forecast and 3DS numbers are down, but Pokemon is right around the corner and we shouldn?t forget about the power of Smash. It just seems like there is some factor that I?m missing from this whole story? Hmmm? Well this is weird. Remember how Iwata skipped E3 because of a surgery he needed? Apparently he hasn?t been performing his regular duties and returned to work only just yesterday. So, the past 5 months Iwata was away on sick leave happened to the be the most successful for Nintendo in years. It could be a strange coincidence or it could be that Iwata is secretly a fiscal vampire.

Games like Sonic Adventure 2, Nights into Dreams, and a slew of classics. But a long awaited PS3 exclusive has been revealed to be making its way to PC via the SEGA twitter account. Valkyria Chronicles was a turn-based strategy game exclusive to the PS3 that came along really early in the platform's life cycle. It was a great succes though and for some awful reason it's sequels were PSP exclusive. Gross! Well it looks like SEGA has finally come back around to the original and announced the game is being ported to PC, with more details to follow. If I had to guess it will make it to Steam and if we're lucky, we'll get it before the end of the year. Merry Christmas!In other news, Microsoft and Nintendo are ready to break into the health market. First Microsoft revealed their wearable to compete with Sony, Apple, and my FitBit here. For $200 the little gadget will measure heart rate, sleep, stress, how many calories you burn, and the amount of sun exposure you receive. It collects and stores the data on their cloud-based platform and will even work as a smartdevice that can interact with your phone. But how the hell is Nintendo going to get into this? Well the first thing they did was work with a third-party who knows a thing or two about sleep products called ResMed. From there, they decided that rather than design a wearable, they wanted to put a device in your bedroom that would monitor your sleep and visualize fatigue. The technical name is the QOL sensor, but I like to call it the eye of Sauron, because it will watch how you sleep and record body movement, breathing, heart rate, and probably other things you won't want to know about. There's no word on it working in tandem with an existing Nintendo device, but it'll chart behaviors over time and make suggestions on how to be healthier. Like, try not to eat an entire box of pizza pockets before bed or turn off the QOL Sensor before you have a bad sexual experience with your partner. Thanks Nintendo!And lastly, Keiji Inafune has been hard at work on Mighty No. 9, but that doesn't mean there isn't time to squeeze just a few more dollars out of its fanbase and backers. The company revealed Via a Kickstarter update they would like to develop some potential DLC for Summer of 2015, a few months after the expected ship date, but that sort of development isn't going to be free. No, Comcept and the teams working with them estimate they'll need about $198,000 to complete the new boss character, stage, and implementation. The character proposed is Beck's rival, codenamed Ray, who very much resembles a mashup of Protoman and Zero. And like Protoman's origin story Ray's is fairly similar. He's an incomplete robot design, but in Beck's universe he feeds on other robots to survive. A sort of digital vampire if you will. So the more copies of the game Comcept sells via the Support page, the better the chance of Ray becoming a reality. Just one question… How the fuck has Capcom not sued Inafune yet?.So I'm going to start featuring comments from the previous episode of Hard News and today's comes from tovartalero who asked \"Sean you seem down today, are you sick? =(?” Actually tovart, I was feeling a bit under the weather yesterday from staying up too late raiding in Destiny. Well that and I hadn't seen a single armor drop after five runs.

Shuhei Yoshida has decided to drop bombs this Halloween by declaring the PlayStation Plus version of DRIVECLUB is dead on arrival, indefinitely. According to French outlet the issues that led to this decision have very little to do with the servers, but it is in fact an issue in the game's code itself. Regardless, it won't make the statement from Yoshida on the DRIVECLUB Facebook page any easier to swallow. \"\"Unfortunately, the time frames required to roll out the fully connected experience will be longer than anticipated and we do not have an exact time frame for when they will be resolved… we will be postponing the release of the PS Plus Edition until further notice.” So fuck you if you bought a PS4 back when this was supposed to be a free launch title. I don't really understand how the guys who spent years perfecting the Motorstorm franchise could deliver a product that is just so fucking broken. But I am most disappointed by how PlayStation has dealt with all this.  Speaking of dealing with poorly developed games, Bethesda has decided to say fuck it all completely and just cancel Prey 2. The open-world space bounty sim was coming to us from Human Head and looked incredible in its 2011 demo. Somehow they figured it just wasn't worth their time anymore and chose to cancel the project entirely. This isn't a big surprise as Human Head kind of went apeshit on Bethesda's parent company ZeniMax back in 2012 because of a shitty contract. Bethesda said the game wasn't cancelled at that time, but today Pete Hines confirmed to CNET that Prey 2 is in fact done. The Bethesda VP says it \"\"wasn't an easy decision, but it's one that won't surprise many folks”. Still, it is quite a disappointment after such a promising demo. I know the universe of Prey wasn't something that people remembered fondly, vagina doors, but the Blade Runner like universe of its sequel seemed like a place I wanted to be. I'll just have to prey...  And finally, Call of Duty had a CGI trailer leak that points to Advanced Warfare getting its own zombie mode in addition to the already revealed singleplayer, multiplayer and horde modes. In the trailer you see waves of undead soldiers overwhelming the character you inhabit. Some of the zombies are even wearing EXO suits and using jetpacks to climb walls and snatch your cohorts out of helicopters. Activision has been doing its best to combat the undead horde by pulling as many videos down from the Internet as possible. Here's hoping this video doesn't find itself flagged before the end of the evening. Remember the game is coming out on Monday, so it is pretty long in the tooth to be revealing new content, but that doesn't mean it won't happen. And hey, it's just more decaying meat sacks for you to kill with your friends.  Our comment of the day comes from Otaku Kawaii Desu-Chan who asks \"\"Hey Sean, what do you think is the best video game to play on Halloween??” I usually just marathon horror movies, but I guess something like Resident Evil 2 or Slender would be pretty great picks. Maybe spending sometime with Bitch Tits from Alien: Isolation will make for a frightening evening. I hope you g1s have a fun and safe Halloween and we'll see you next week.  I'm Sean and THAT was Hard News!  Hey guess what, the latest Death Battle is finally live! That means you can watch Ryu and Scorpion pummeling each other to hell and back.","length":220,"original_air_date":"2014-10-31T12:50:00.000Z","channel_id":"92b6bb21-91d2-4b1b-bf95-3268fa0d9939","channel_slug":"rooster-teeth","season_id":"ffa2901d-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","season_slug":"hard-news-season-1","season_number":1,"show_title":"Hard News","show_id":"ff932b21-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","show_slug":"hard-news","is_sponsors_only":false},"uuid":"0016ea8b-464e-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","archive":{"id":"roosterteeth-7023","status":"archived","files":[{"name":"2014-10-31_Call_of_Duty_Zombie_Leak_Driveclub_PS_Infinite_Delay_Prey_2_Cancelled__Hard_News_103114_[7023].description","filesize":3464,"file_ext":"description","md5":"93530570b484377eb888425feaff137b"},{"name":"2014-10-31_Call_of_Duty_Zombie_Leak_Driveclub_PS_Infinite_Delay_Prey_2_Cancelled__Hard_News_103114_[7023].info.json","filesize":23511,"file_ext":"json","md5":"eb0318f0bbcbe1607eb854431b05c736"},{"name":"2014-10-31_Call_of_Duty_Zombie_Leak_Driveclub_PS_Infinite_Delay_Prey_2_Cancelled__Hard_News_103114_[7023].jpg","filesize":142682,"file_ext":"jpg","md5":"a7a3f24bda8d92426f0f9557f0248808"},{"name":"2014-10-31_Call_of_Duty_Zombie_Leak_Driveclub_PS_Infinite_Delay_Prey_2_Cancelled__Hard_News_103114_[7023].mp4","filesize":114929369,"file_ext":"mp4","md5":"6b8ea0cf52fdc182e0be21ebac47a7e5"}]}},{"id":7024,"type":"episode","attributes":{"title":"Smash Bros. 136 Year Ban, The Internet Arcade, Korean eSports Money | Hard News 11/3/14","slug":"smash-bros-136-year-ban-the-internet-arcade-korean-esports-money-hard-news-11314","number":0,"description":"I'm Sean Hinz and this is Hard News for Monday November 3, 2014.The mid-twenties eSports player should be excited for their potential future as huge financial gains are coming through the news pipeline. First the Korean eSports association has decided to establish a ?minimum salary policy? for Korean pros in the 2015 LoL season. The Korean sports community has similar standards for their traditional sports teams of around $27,000 per year. So I expect once they announce the minimum for League, it will be around $20k. But if you?ve been a pro for a few years and even won a tournament or two, you can make a whole lot more money without even playing in an eSport. Wei Han Dong or CaoMei has been an eSports athlete for the past 5 years and just recently retired at the old-age of 22. But by athletic standards he should have another four years left in him, so why is he bowing out so early? Well according to Portrait magazine, as translated by ongamers, Wei has a contract to become a full-time streamer for $800,000 per year. And the story hints that this is a trend for China?s top eSports athletes, who want out of the rat-race for an easier lifestyle and massive salary. Unfortunately, at the age of 30 I am the Dry-Bones of eSports athletes. Damn my frail old body! Oww...And speaking of old, remember when there were those mystical places known as arcades? They were wedged between the pizza parlor and candy store in your local mall and housed an entire generation of games that today?s youth know nothing of. Well, what if I told you that right now in your browser, you can play over 900 classic arcade games and it won?t cost you a single quarter! The Internet Archive has joined forces with JSMAME to open The Internet Arcade, a browser-based emulator that houses a ton of games from the 1970?s, all the way into the early 90?s. You have classics like Burgertime and Defender, the obscure like Goalie Ghost or Journey, and some more modern titles like Outrun and Street Fighter II. Firefox is the best browser from a performance standpoint. Also, both Firefox and Chrome have gamepad support, just make sure your plugged in before you boot the game and jiggle the joystick as it boots. It?s not everyday I get to jiggle my joystick. Had to find a way to talk about my dick somehow.Speaking of dicks, Nintendo doesn?t care about your feelings! Super Smash brothers 3DS is dishing out lifetime bans for griefing other players during group matches. The ban is massive considering the innocence of such a crime, totalling 71,582,030 minutes or roughly 136 years. Normally a ban for picking on another player is up to 15 minutes, but one Reddit user determined this insane number is coming about due to a programming error. So the only way to ensure this ban doesn?t fall upon you is to avoid online mode entirely for now, with one-on-one mode being the exception. Theoretically. But I for one find the entire anti-griefer technology absurd. While Nintendo has yet to respond to the bug, they should also explain why trolling your friends should result in a ban at all. The fact that attacking the same person too many times will get banned is fucking insane! This is a game where you fight people in an attempt to obliterate your opponent. So you punish me for not evenly distributing my destruction?! Don?t tell me how to play your game! This is like telling humans to stop being human. If you don?t want me to have to kill the same person, over and over again, then tell those players to sack up and stop me. Arrghhh...Our comment of the day comes from TheOmegaGenerator who asks ?Sean, why do you take Driveclub's launch so seriously? Its just a racing game??. Well Omega, despite the genre this is a Sony published game and although Evolution is the company responsible, Sony was the guy who felt the product was good enough to launch. Obviously that was a bad choice. And I love racing games, so that makes me extra sad. If you want to make me happy, Like, Share, and Subscribe!I?m Sean and THAT was Hard News.Hopefully everyone had a Happy Halloween over the weekend. To celebrate, we had a pumpkin pie eating contest in the office where Austin, Paker, and Nick tried to eat as much of the pie as possible in 4 minutes.","length":290,"original_air_date":"2014-11-03T12:58:00.000Z","channel_id":"92b6bb21-91d2-4b1b-bf95-3268fa0d9939","channel_slug":"rooster-teeth","season_id":"ffa2901d-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","season_slug":"hard-news-season-1","season_number":1,"show_title":"Hard News","show_id":"ff932b21-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","show_slug":"hard-news","is_sponsors_only":false},"uuid":"0016e441-464e-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","archive":{"id":"roosterteeth-7024","status":"archived","files":[{"name":"2014-11-03_Smash_Bros._136_Year_Ban_The_Internet_Arcade_Korean_eSports_Money__Hard_News_11314_[7024].description","filesize":4237,"file_ext":"description","md5":"ae8e4ad5427b0b340523ca01ce2ddee1"},{"name":"2014-11-03_Smash_Bros._136_Year_Ban_The_Internet_Arcade_Korean_eSports_Money__Hard_News_11314_[7024].info.json","filesize":24242,"file_ext":"json","md5":"a4c4ecb8cf1d655433223077d345a156"},{"name":"2014-11-03_Smash_Bros._136_Year_Ban_The_Internet_Arcade_Korean_eSports_Money__Hard_News_11314_[7024].jpg","filesize":162760,"file_ext":"jpg","md5":"496f741e9b23ee0f847e130cad4c0171"},{"name":"2014-11-03_Smash_Bros._136_Year_Ban_The_Internet_Arcade_Korean_eSports_Money__Hard_News_11314_[7024].mp4","filesize":152311471,"file_ext":"mp4","md5":"e3cbeccc25d2e2f4b6d55db111ebc061"}]}},{"id":7025,"type":"episode","attributes":{"title":"Oddworld Wii U Woes, Camp Pokemon is a FREE, Metallica & Hearthstone @ BlizzCon | Hard News 10/22/14","slug":"oddworld-wii-u-woes-camp-pokemon-is-a-free-metallica-hearthstone-blizzcon-hard-news-102214","number":0,"description":"I'm Sean Hinz and this is Hard News for Wednesday October 22, 2014.Oddworld: New \"N” Tasty has already launched on PlayStation 4 this past July, but there hasn't been any word on the Wii U version since then. In fact all versions from PC, Mac, and Linux to Xbox platforms currently have a generic 2014 date, so what gives? Well series creator Lorne Lanning recently mentioned on the Fragments of Silicon podcast that the Wii U delay may be tied to the smaller 8GB Basic model. Lanning was quoted as saying they are \"having challenges with not having a hard disk, but we're trying to overcome those challenges,\" and that \"If you're going to make a Wii U game, it better run on the 8GB unit… Otherwise, it's not really a Wii U game.\" The official Twitter account confirmed they were working through some challenges, only some of which deal with the 8GB model, and the game is not cancelled. This whole scenario reminds me of when Microsoft sold the Xbox 360 Core with only a 4 GB HDD and you couldn't play Halo Reach co-op. Won't someone think of the children?!Speaking of kids, The Pokémon Company like Nintendo is finally embracing the smartphone technology that is basically a part of everyday life and releasing a Pokémon game on it! Yayyy!!! Called Camp Pokémon, the free app for iOS that will teach you everything you need to know to become the next great Pokémon trainer. Campers start their adventure on a mysterious Pokémon island as they engage in Pokémon themed activities like Poké Ball Throw and Find the Pokémon. There's even a Pokémon Pin collecting meta-game and a Photo Booth mode complete with stickers. Yayyyy!!! The Director of Marketing for the Pokémon Company says \"Kids will have a blast exploring Camp Pokémon as they immerse themselves in the Pokémon universe” because why the fuck would anyone want to play an actual Pokémon game on their phone, when they can enjoy a collection of shitty mini-games, re-skinned for Pokémon fans? Yayyy…..Onto something phone fans may actually be pining for… Blizzard's collectable card game Hearthstone should arrive on iOS and Android in 2015. This is a slight delay from the end of 2014 timeline Blizzard originally anticipated for these devices, but they hope to launch on Android tablets by then. A developer noted that \"one of the biggest challenges [with that] is revamping the user interface so it feels intuitive and offers the same quality Hearthstone experience\". But what plans will Blizzard have in store for their upcoming event BlizzCon? Well how about Metallica closing out the community event at the Anaheim Convention Center and broadcasting it to virtual ticket holders. So for $40 you can catch two days of eSports action and potential new game news. Then, top off the entire weekend with some face melting music from the fathers of metal.

After a lackluster initial Iron Banner, the dev has planned an updated version of the PVP event that would deliver on its promises. Somehow late last night, someone must have flipped the wrong switch when pushing out the Tuesday refresh and the Iron Banner was live for a few hours. There's no official comment from Bungie, but the event was pulled while they assumably got their shit together. One good talking point is they did confirm yesterday that not all the previously announced DLC is tied to the Dark Below expansion. Whether or not you purchase the $20 content pack, players will still gain access to new weapons, armor, bounties, and the long sought after five additional bounty slots. But for us hardcore players, that doesn't mean a damn thing without the new raid, so I guess we have to pony up the cash. Speaking of which, tonight's raid night and we're running hard mode! BOOOTTTSSSS!While we're on the subject of raiding, Blizzard has dropped the ban hammer on a bunch of bots trying to raid Hearthstone. A bot dev called Crawlerbot designed a bot to grind out wins in the game and climb the leaderboards. A bunch a scamps had been using the service, but all have now been banned and the dev has closed its Hearthstone bot down. In a message to the community on it's website, Crawlerbot says \"the recent ban wave in Hearthstone hit a lot of users. After discussing this with Blizzard, it's clear we have to take off our services/products now… We are very sad about this but you also know botting is against the rules and we all knew that the day when our products doesn't work anymore would come. With tears in our eyes we have to say bye.” Sounds like Crawlerbot should have built themselves a Grammarbot amiright?! Hahaha... They don't know how to English so good.And lastly, just yesterday I poked fun at the notion arcades were still a thing here in the states. Mostly because they aren't, unless you work at ScrewAttack or you live in Japan. Despite generation after generation, arcades are still wildly popular there and Nintendo has partnered with Capcom to bring an epic franchise to the coin-munching past time. Luigi Mansion Arcade is a theater cabinet, with a massive screen and light-gun versions of Luigi's Poltergust 5000 vacuum. It was spotted in the wild between October 30th and November 3rd as part of a location test over the Halloween Weekend, but there is no confirmation that this will hit mass production. And I certainly wouldn't hold my breath for a Western release. This sort-of partnership is common for Nintendo, with Bandai-Namco bringing both Mario Kart cabinets to arcades on their behalf. But for some reason, the idea Capcom is developing this makes me feel yucky. There's a Nintendo Direct tomorrow at 4 PM CST on ScrewAttack, so maybe they'll mention it… But probably not.Our Comment of the Day comes from Remixking who asks \"Shaun do you pancakes?” Oh man, do I ever. While I prefer french toast, pancakes are a major part of my favorite food, breakfast! It's great because unlike any other food, breakfast food is appropriate at anytime.

Let me know how you like your pancakes in the comments!I'm Sean and THAT was Hard News!The new One Minute Melee went live yesterday and it surprised the hell out of me. Not because of the match-up, it's Batman versus Wesker, but because the fight is all 3D models. Oh snap that's badass!

Dawngate was supposed to be the EA answer to League, but after an 18-month beta, the publisher has pulled the plug on the project. The group's general manager Matt Bromberg posted on EA's blog that like all projects, EA went in with \"great hopes and expectations… but beta testing is about learning and improving, and ultimately, about making difficult decisions.\" And frankly, its just been awhile since we killed something with our own hands. Oh sorry, I added that last part. If you'd spent money while participating in the Beta, you're an idiot, but EA will be issuing refunds. We'd seen Dawngate before, but it never peaked piqued our interest much. Maybe Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm can shake up the powerhouses that are DOTA 2 and League of Legends. In More MOBA news, Riot has finally revealed their latest champion named Kalista. She's a marksman type who binds with an allied champion and supports them with a variety of offensive abilities. Here's Sam, our resident League expert to lend his thoughts.Thanks Sam!Now if you couldn't care less about something in video games, how's about the upcoming 10th anniversary of Killzone? A franchise known as that Playstation shooter who tries really hard, has still managed to produce six games across five platforms of various quality. The ongoing war between th ISA and Helghast is getting a massive DLC bump over the next month in celebration, in addition to the Season Pass DLC that just came out. You will find new multiplayer skins, skins for your OWL, voice packs, player cards, and new crosshairs. Oh goody… Then there are three multiplayer maps, one for PVP, two for co-op. Still not convinced this is a true 10 year anniversary, how about an art show, tournaments, livestreams, and free shit on social media?! I guess it isn't a remastered collection of the original trilogy for next gen consoles, but we can't all be Halo now can we? And lastly, an alleged leak of some screenshots for Just Cause 3 may point to the franchise going free-to-play with microtransactiions. Taken from a debug unit and watermarked to hell and back, the images show Rico vacationing on a beautiful island in search of destruction. Then a menu screen reveals the option to purchase gems which can be used as some sort of currency in the returning Black Market feature. A mode which delivers all manner of weapons, vehicles and other fun toys to your person. With the game probably being published by Square Enix, we should have seen this coming. Just look at what has happened to Final Fantasy?! Both the developers and publishers have declined to comment, but somewhere there is a Nick Cramer weeping over the bastardization of one of his favorite franchises. Don't worry Nick. I'm sure we'll still be able to grapple a person to a car, to a jet, to a plane, to a blimp; and then crash into a mountain. Provided you have enough money.And our comment of the day comes from GreenNinja Tea who says \"Hardnews report the normalboots dating game that was put on kickstarter (im serious this is real and they already have $4,000)?.” So here's a special bonus report. Asagao Academy: Normal Boots Club is an indie otome game or romance-oriented visual novel from a female perspective being developed by Cara Hillstock. It looks like it's going to meet its crowdfunding goal of $12,000, being nearly halfway there after the opening week. The premise is straightforward, you're the new girl at school and it's filled with sexy YouTubers. Now we know a bunch of these guys and can't help but find it hilarious that there is over 35 hours worth of content including a scene where ProJared shows off his modeling photos. YESSS!! I smell a playthrough on the ScrewAttack Live channel incoming. I have now reported on this, so now I must be in it. I'm Sean and THAT was Hard News.Sidescrollers is live on the site right now and Craig and the crew talk about video games for the first time in months.

Just more fun fan service for the 3DS exclusive. Oh and don't forget to scoop up Ultimate NES Remix on December 5th. It should be perfect for pick up and play handheld sessions.    Now we're going to deviate for a second while I consider the upcoming release of amiibos. These little figurines are launching soon and for the first time we can understand what they're going to do in software other than Smash. Amiibos on Mario Kart 8 will unlock said amiibo's costume for your Mii in-game. So it's kind of like you get to wear your amiibo's skin like a suit. There are a dozen compatible amiibos right now and I bet the add Villager with the Mario Kart DLC in 2015. For Hyrule Warriors all amiibos are compatible and will give you items or rupies, BUT in the case of Link you get a new weapon, the Spinner from Twilight Princess. Then an additional game was added to the amiibo compatibility list with Kirby and the Rainbow Curse. But we don't know how it will work inside the game itself. Maybe they'll let you ditch all those Waddle-Dee's for a cool character. Add three other games becoming compatible in 2015, it seems like I might have to get one or two this Holiday Season. GG Nintendo.    Finally we finish with the Wii U. Duck Hunt dog was confirmed for Super Smash Bros. Wii U and surprise!!! Duck Hunt is coming to Virtual Console with a teased Zapper accessory. I suppose Nintendo felt they had to reveal something… Miyamoto has been working on the Pikmin animation project we heard about. Pikmin Short movies released yesterday for $5 on Wii U and 3DS, in HD and 3D respectively. In addition to the 3 short movies, the demo of Pikmin 3 is also available and the save data will carry over to a full game. Xenoblade Chronicles X was talked about a little. It takes place in New Los Angeles, where the world continues to look more and more insane than even it's real world counterpart can manage. You're tasked with the survival of the human race in an \"\"Epic” RPG setting, with an emphasis on exploration. Expect more when it releases sometime in 2015. And Splatoon has revealed to an incredible looking campaign, in addition to its core multiplayer combat. Please please please make it coop Nintendo! After the new trailer came the quote ”Squid versus Octopus, nature's epic battle for supremacy”, which is about the coolest fucking thing Iwata-san has ever said. Squid FTW!    So, how did it look?

Metro 2033 is free on Humble Bundle today, just login to the link in the description and get your copy. You'll need it because the rest of today's news sucks! With all the Call of Duty fanfare happening around the Internet, news is dominated by bullshit, so we're gonna bro out and hit some of the biggest piles of shit around the Internet.  DICE has managed to cram parts of Battlefield 4 onto your mobile device using Apple's new low-level graphics API Metal. Now this isn't the full game by any means, but more just a tech demo to test the potential of using DICE's Frostbite engine on mobile devices. Kristoffer Benjaminsson from the Stockholm office says \"\"Even though we have much room for performance improvements on our end, we're pleasantly surprised of the performance we're getting from the hardware.” And I guess this would help them to catch up with Unreal which has been supporting mobile for a few years now. To celebrate Battlefield 4's annual Battle Fest, they've also created a Game Time offer which will give players a 168 hour trial on EA's Origin platform for PC. The timer won't start until the game launches and EA would really like you to stop playing so much Call of Duty right now.  Speaking of Call of Duty, the latest installment in the franchise has decided not to support the PS4's latest feature Share Play. Normally guests would be able to join a local multiplayer session and get into some Kill Confirmed, but not in the case of Advanced Warfare. So what gives? Well and Activision rep let everyone know that they didn't have time to test the feature leading up to the game's release and they're \"\"focused on launching Advanced Warfare and ensuring that people have a great time playing it”. But once they get a chance to put the new feature through its paces, they will make a decision on whether or not to support it. Sony also chimed in to remind everyone that \"\"the option is available to developers to disable the feature according to what they feel will best benefit the consumer experience.” It's kind of nice that Activision cares enough about your experience to delay a feature. I wonder how different things would be if EA felt the same way about Battlefield?  And finally, it looks like Pepsi is working on the next Mountain Dew flavor and it's a dewsie.. HAHAHA. In an ongoing attempt to ensure the Kent State University population is getting their vitamins, Mountain Dew is testing some new flavors like Lemon Ginger, Mango Habanero and Dewitos. That's right, Doritos flavored Mountain Dew which has been quoted as tasting \"\"like orange with a doritos aftertaste” or it's \"\"like if you shoved a handful of Doritos in your mouth and chugged some Dew at the same time.\"\" The best has to have come from joes_nipples who said \"\"it honestly wasn't that disgusting”. How high our standards have come that a nacho cheese chip flavored beverage and source of diabetes, is somehow not all that bad. If you've ever wondered what Call of Duty might taste like, it's probably just like a nice refreshing glass of Dewitos.  Our comment of the day comes from Harman Smile who says \"\"when i see hard news is up my dingus points to the heavens with pride and honor?”. Knowing that I bring honor to your dingus Harman means the world to me. And I too point skyward on every episode of Hard News. Thanks for a great week g1s.

As many of you have already heard, Blizzard announced its newest IP, Overwatch. It looks to be a team-based first-person shooter, a la Team Fortress or even Gearbox's new IP Battleborn. While the highly cinematic announcement trailer is gorgeous, you should be most excited about the gameplay trailer, which somehow manages to capture the iconic art style and also offer a wide variety of combat options. It should be noted the scuttle butt is this game emerged from the remains of the cancelled MMO Titan, and I look forward to more details.Other quick news bits from the event include the launch of the first expansion for Hearthstone. Goblins vs. Gnomes should arrive next month with over 120 new cards and the long requested spectator mode. Heroes of the Storm's newest Hero was revealed to be the Blizzard classic Lost Vikings, but with the gameplay split between three controllable avatars it won't necessarily be for all players. But who cares, because their ultimate ability has you fording a lane in a badass longship. It'll be the perfect viking funeral for your foes. And lastly, we received the tiniest snippet of information regarding the final expansion for Starcraft 2. New units, modes and even a beta is incoming, but the best news is that this will be a stand-alone release. Noobs are encouraged to jump right for the grand finale. Blizzard probably just didn't want to have to sell you a game that is over five years old to simply play an expansion. Just like they don't really care if you grind to 90 in WoW either.Enough Starcrafts and Blizzards, let's move onto some news regarding Nintendo's upcoming toy line of amiibo. As the \"Big N” announced this morning, it will be teaming up with Loot Crate to offer up an amiibo distribution service by mail. The 10 included amiibo are all pre-selected and will be delivered in three care packages throughout the holiday season. Already announced amiibo include Mario, Yoshi, Pikachu, Donkey Kong, and Fox; while the other five remain a mystery. There is no subscription length or price, but it is hard to see where the value lies.It's just like ordering one from Amazon, only without the burden of getting the one you actually want. Register your email on Loot Crate's site for the latest updates. One other amiibo rumor coming from IGN, licensing manager Damon Baker told the news outlet that they are considering opening up the amiibo integration to some of their third-party partners. No word on what that might entail, but I bet the first step would be finding a third-party who will partner with the Wii U.Speaking of partners, Geoff Keighly is pulling out the big guns and re-launching his annual Game Awards Show, one more time. He's previously been the host of Spike's annual gaming award show and the awful revamp from last year called VGX. But Geoff ain't fucking around because his advisory board is made up of key members of Xbox, Sony, PlayStation, Konami, EA, Valve, Rockstar, and Ubisoft. Fuck you Activision! Notable members include Reggie Fils-Aime and Phil Spencer, who I can only hope will mud wrestle live from the Axis Theater in the lovely Las Vegas this December 5th. It will be livestreamed on basically every console, so there's no reason to miss out on a chance for Joe McHale to remind everyone that Geoff wears too many jackets, while embarrassing all of his esteemed guests.If you hadn't heard Rooster Teeth is the latest member of the Fullscreen family and I'm sure you're wondering \"what it all means?” Well, it was just announced today and should be learning more about our new BFFs from Austin as the week goes on. Stay tuned g1s!Our comment of the day comes from FireHawkX who says \"Sean : What does G'ones mean??

Unfortunately many gamers are experiencing various matchmaking issues at launch. While it isn't affecting everyone, many regions have seen extremely long search times and the inability to get into a game. 343i has already issued a patch and they're working hard to make sure players are having the best experience at launch. A PR rep says \"Matching times will improve as we continue to roll out. If you do not find a match after a few minutes, please restart your search.” A process that may seem cumbersome for many who were under the impression that Microsoft's cloud-based Azure platform would make for a smooth launch. I just like to imagine logging on and playing Halo 2 with friendos is like having a hard poo. The first 15 minutes might be painful, but once you've defeated the corn filled monstrosity, no victory feels grander.Onto better news, Nintendo has already confirmed the launch of the next wave of amiibo following the Loot Crate partnership we discussed yesterday. Scheduled for a release window in February of 2015, Nintendo will bring an additional 11 figurines to the toy lineup, making for a total 27 toys in the pipeline. The newest members include; Toon Link, Sheik, Ike, Shulk, Lucario, Meta Knight, King Dee Dee Dee, Rosalina, Bowser, Sonic and Mega Man. With characters like Sonic and Mega Man in the mix, I feel it is pretty clear the third party support Nintendo might be looking for in the future. Let's just hope the next games in those respective franchises are also fun to play. I'm looking at you Sonic Boom.One issue we weren't aware of is the limited functionality of these amiibo. As observed by CVG on the Japanese amiibo page, the official description says an amiibo may only store data for a single game at a time. That won't affect Mario Kart or Hyrule Warriors since you're basically unlocking content using an amiibo, but as more games provide some sort of persistent character, you might have to pick and chose. Or you could just buy dups of the same amiibo for multiple games if you don't want to lose your data. So, Nintendo of America… You going to mention this at all before the launch on the 21st? Or are you just going to sodomize us?And finally, secrets and rumors surrounding Just Cause 3 have lead to all sorts of rampant speculation, but it looks like the wait is finally over. Game Informer has revealed Just Cause 3 as the cover story for the December issue and they'll be handling up on a month of exclusive news surrounding the property. Avalanche Studios' New York City office has been working on the game for the past three years and it looks like it is about ready for public consumption. Since this is a tease for a wealth of content being parsed out over the next month, there aren't many details, but there are some clarifications. According to co-founder Christofer Sundberg, Just Cause 3 will launch in 2015 on PC, Xbone, and PS4. Also, \"it is not a Free To Play game” and \"it does not feature in-game microtransactions.” I expect all manner of chaotic grappling, explosive mayhem, and gorgeous tropical vistas are awaiting us. For the authority on all things Just Cause, here's special guest Nick Cramer!Thanks Nick! I'll make sure to get you that ambulance as soon as this episode is over.Our comment of the day comes from SomeDUMG4MER… that's his name… I ugh, don't actually think you're stupid… who asks, \"why are you guys in LA?” I don't Know SomeDUMG4MER.

Thanks PC master race!Onto more great gaming news, Game of Thrones Ironrath from the adventure game masters over at Telltale has finally had some more information revealed regarding its 2014 launch. Episode one should release before the end of the year on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC; with the additional platforms like PS4, Xbox One, Mac, and iOS coming later. The story will focus in the north of Westeros and players will be jumping into the boots of five members of the House Forrester. They are keepers of the Wolfswood, a forest of ironwood trees which fall under the banner of house Stark. You'll still travel to iconic locations like the Kings Landing and The Wall, but much of the story will play out between House Forrester and their rivals, House Whitewall. The first episode's title is based on the Forrester House motto, Iron from Ice. No word on an official release, which is discouraging considering there are six weeks left in the year… I blame George RR Martin for the delay.

Badges, which are necessary to unlock all the stages and track you general progress, so you'd hope for a big reward. That was what you got instead… Will someone please just shoot Sonic in the face already?And finally, it appears that everyone had a rough launch yesterday because Assassin's Creed Unity is not reviewing that well. Inspite of it's ambition visuals and unique setting, the game is plagued with glitches. I myself experienced one last night when I tried moving left on a ledge and the frame rate plummeted. There is also a ton of texture pop, the occasional open world jank, and general malaise surrounding the annualized franchise. Leading to a 10% drop in the value of Ubisoft's stock yesterday. It went from $3.62, down to $3.29, but opened today at $3.42. It seems like it might have settled, but frankly it is the laughing stock of much of the Internet right now. Yahoo Finance editor Tae Kim says Ubisoft would have been better off delaying the game a few months rather than \"Assassin's Creed Unity is reminding gamers of EA's Battlefield 4 launch problems last year.” Awww snap!

Subscribers to the Xbox One exclusive service is delivering on its promises with access to the first six hours of this massive RPG, a whole five days before release. Progress will carry over to the main game, so EA is kind of like your pusher, who for $5 per month, will get you hooked on all the latest EA properties. Sounds like Inquisition might just be the perfect drug.Speaking of addictions, Mario Kart 8 has dropped its first chunk of DLC for all of you fuel heads out there. It's sort of a landmark event for the franchise by not only offering up additional courses, karts, and characters; but featuring crossover content from franchises like The Legend of Zelda and Excitebike. An update will accompany the DLC, adding amiibo support and unlocking the on-disc DLC racing suits for your Miis. In other Mario Kart news, unrelated to the DLC, Nintendo of Japan and Mercedes again teamed up to make a couple more of those bizarre commercials for the GLA. This time featuring Princess Peach and a poppin' and lockin' Luigi. The commercials don't really make we want to buy a car, but they do make me want to move to Japan. What a kooky place…In more offbeat ideas from the land of the rising sun, a Japanese developer is taking a crack at making a peripheral for Sony's recently released PlayStation TV. The incredibly small device is getting a rather large docking station called the DekaVita 7, that essentially turns your microconsole into a PlayStation Vita. It adds analog nubs, a 7-inch screen without touch support, and costs about $230. Making it the least useful portable in the history of hardware considering that the Vita already exists and has more features. While I am sure it is completely functional, it still begs the question, why?????While that offbeat product was coming from a third-party, PlayStation is having its own issues regarding their newest micro console. Just today the hardware giant revealed the PlayStation Vue, their TV streaming service for the PS3 and PS4. But the PlayStation TV is noticeably absent from their lineup of supported hardware. The cloud-based subscription service will start broadcasting in 2015 and deliver on demand content from NBC, Scripps Network Interactive, Discovery, Viacom, FOX, and CBS. But Sony's service has done little to differentiate itself from other players in that business like Hulu or Amazon. Long-term they will support iPad and \"more Sony and non-Sony devices.” Theoretically that means PlayStation TV won't be far behind, but I can't think of a product I've had more buyers remorse for than that damn microconsole.And we end today's news with footage of a flaccid penis in Far Cry 4. It's a bit blurry, but finally gender equality has come to gaming!Today's comment of the day comes from thistlewayman \"Sean why do you look down on me today, I thought we were on equal footing.....” In the case of yesterday's \"interesting” camera angle, you can thank Nick Cramer and John Francis McCullagh who claimed everything looked fine on their end when we shot the episode.

It isn't as great of a deal as fans would have hoped, but there are some perks to using the program. Three payments of $55 will get these delivered straight to your door over the next six weeks. The first crate includes Donkey Kong, Mario, Kirby and Pikachu; plus a mini-magazine, sticker, and wristband. Then you have Fox, Yoshi, Peach, and Samus in the second crate; plus another mini-magazine and cinch bag. Finally, the third crate will include Luigi and Zelda, a third mini-magazine and some super rare t-shirt. It's limited edition type stuff, for nearly $35 more, instead of buying the figurines for $130 individually. Considering they already sold out, I bet Nintendo is more than happy with the decision.Another decision I imagine Nintendo be happy about is the creation of yet another fight pad for the upcoming release of Smash. We know about PDP making four exclusive pads for launch alongside the Wii U fighter, plus the Gamecube adapter coming from the Big N themselves. Now Hori is getting on the hype train with the release of the electric mouse inspired Pikachu themed fight pad. It looks just like the Gamcube-style controller of yester-year and connects through a Wiimote which can also rock a matching cover. It appears this may be a Japanese exclusive for now, but Hori is also selling Mario and Luigi themed fight pads here in the states. There are a number of ways to get your Smash on this holiday season, without having to use that dumbass nunchuck. Thank god for that!Not everything about today can be good news though, as Majesco & Midnight City may be in financial trouble. Having long avoided being delisted from the stock exchange, Majesco invested heavily in their indie branch Midnight City this past year, alongside external re-branding. But after losing the Zumba fitness license and underperforming in the indie space, they have filed a damning report with the SEC. In the documentation Majesco concludes they \"have suffered losses that raise substantial doubt about their [our] ability to continue…” Therefore, they \"are evaluating various alternatives, including reducing operating expenses and personnel costs, securing additional financing for future business activities, and other strategic alternatives including a sale or merger of their [our] company.\" Having also sold off the majority stake in GMS, a social casino game developer, Midnight City is pretty much the only thing they have going and that doesn't look good. Here's hoping everyone over there at the publisher is ready for whatever comes next.And finally, the next big thing that we know almost nothing about is the Game of Thrones tie-in from Telltale Games. But according to Kotaku, a Twitter account focused on XBLA leaked a handful of screenshots that weren't officially revealed by Telltale. As we discussed last week, it will put you in the roll of numerous members of House Forrester, but some fan favorites will be making an appearance. Already Cersi and Tyrion are confirmed if the screens are indeed real and the art-style looks all too familiar coming from that developer. Don't forget that we should also be paying a visit to the Wall, which means John Snow will also make a guest appearance, but will Stannis be there and will we get to see Melisandre's boobs? I guess we'll have to keep speculating and Chad says go read the books.Today's comment of the day comes from DylanYoshi who says \"Blargh, nothing \"begs\" a question. Begging a question is a logical fallacy. The phrase is \"raises a question\". This is slightly bothersooooome!” I realize I might have ended last week's Vita news with a circular argument, but I don't think you're a real Yoshi and that makes you a liar.

If you missed the most glorious simulation of the modern age, don't fret, Goat Simulator is getting an expansion of epic proportions and there is plenty of time left to enjoy it. The MMO-themed expansion pokes fun at taking this physics simulation to the extreme by dropping your hairy ass into a fantasy themed universe complete with thatch roof cottages and idiotic villagers. No one suspects a thing as this mighty goat dons one of his many new armors to lead the village into oblivion. Oh and you can play as a microwave with legs. The expansion drops this Thursday on Steam and will cost zero dollars, so if you can't afford the new Dragon Age, then you should definitely check out the new Goat Simulator.    On the subject of epic RPGs being smashed into a non-role playing game, did you hear about this Final Fantasy 7 thing? A creator named Jamie Colliver gave up the past two years of his life in order to faithfully recreate the entire Final Fantasy 7 experience in LittleBigPlanet 2. Now obviously it isn't a perfect re-creation mechanically, the genres are completely different. But from the aesthetic to its story beats, you can enjoy the game in its entirety, including side missions, across 31 levels. You can also play it in LittleBigPlanet 3 on the PS3, PS4, and Vita which just released today. And for fans who don't own the game, consider popping in on Colliver's YouTube for over a hundred videos documenting his experience and his slow descent into madness. Or at least that what I would imagine spending two years in sack world would be like.    Speaking of crazy people, someone out there thinks that G4 is still a channel. Originally closing up shop in 2012, the gaming-centric tech channel was set to be reborn as the Esquire network in 2013. That apparently fell through, but by then, us gamers and much of the G4 staff had all moved on with their lives. So then it went back to playing re-runs of Cops under the name G4 and it was basically 2010 all over again, but with less viewership. I think it was only running in Kansas if the source of this article is to be understood. Anyway, someone at NBC Universal is getting off their ass to finally kill the poor bastard on November 20th. So let's all have a moment of silence for the reanimated corpse of G4 as it takes a shotgun blast to the face.  Ahhh... That's better!    Our comment of the day comes from Nathan Dunn who says \"\"Man... How I wish Nintendo would make a Wii U Pro Controller shaped like a Gamecube controller. I love the shape and feel of the Gamecube controller, but don't want cables. Plugging it into a Wii remote is just as clumsy as being tethered to the console.

In a clever move by Ubisoft, Far Cry 4 pirates have made themselves known publicly by complaining on social media. Whether intentional or not, the field of view scroller was left out of the retail build, only to be patched in on day one. So when users took to Twitter to complain about the option, game director Alex Hutchinson made it clear to PC players that \"\"if you're online complaining about the lack of FOV control ... You pirated the game.” In my opinion, THAT makes you an asshole.  But Ubi isn't free from dawning such an auspicious title themselves, but this time it is coming from their country of origin. Former Presidential candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon has been critical of Assassin's Creed Unity, calling the game \"\"propaganda” and claims it portrays Maximilien Robespierre as a \"\"monster”, despite being the catalyst of victory for the people in the revolution. Mélenchon concluded that the game \"\"presents an image of hatred of the Revolution, hatred of the people, hatred of the republic which is rampant in the far-right milieux (of today).\"\"Here's the thing Jean-Luc... You imply this game is unpatriotic, but based on the polls, it has had more support of the French people than you did in the last election.  Now the devs behind the game have been learning a lesson or two with the recent launch of AssCreed having so many bugs. The face-off issue affecting PC players should no longer be an issue. It appears it was tied to specific GPU, but has since been resolved. Still there are larger performance issues from the framerate dropping, to awful pop-in and the process of getting everything fixed look promising. Based on feedback, Ubi says they are trying to streamline free-running, tagging objects and prioritizing core utilization. All of these things combined will improve the overall experience. While we don't have timeline for the third patch, the devs are on it and hopeful. But will they get around to fixing the Initiates system? Because no one is mentioning that and it is basically useless.  And finally, Walmart is out thousands of dollars after scammers get the best of them. Thanks to their fairly open-ended price matching policy, customers began using Amazon to generate some deep discounts on PS4 that weren't actually real. But Walmart didn't know that. So when a customer went in with a print out of an Amazon sales page offering up a PS4 for $90, what choice did the retailer have but to honor the promotion. It looks like the opportunity circulated online for a day or two before people started bragging about their victories on social media and utlimately making the big box retailer aware of their mistake. Some might blame the employees for not verifying the promotion, but considering they're one of the poor bastards who have to work on Thanksgiving, I say karmas a bitch. Kind of funny that no one tried to scam Walmart for an Xbox One, huh?   Our comment of the day comes from ajtwista92 who says, \"\"Is it me or is Sean slowly turning into Monetary Jack from Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers? He just needs to gain 50-60 pounds, a blue turtleneck, and an overcoat.” I uhhh… Don't know what you're talking about. CHEEEESE!!!  I'm Jack and THAT was Hard News!  We're back for another episode of Sidescrollers. This time Chad, Sam, and Craig show off our new set; while they talk about SGC dates, a crazy few weeks of broken games, and a Florida story or two.

Specifically iOS and Android. It's good to know since we can all stop caring about another free-to-play cash cow for EA. Frankly, this isn't the Need for Speed we're looking for. Let's try this new game announcement thing again…Square Enix has announced a new Final Fantasy game, three in fact and they're all for mobile devices… Dammit!  Final Fantasy Legends – Crystal of Time, Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, and the Final Fantasy Portal App are all destined for iOS and Android in 2015. Crystal of Time is a \"time-traveling RPG” and looks like it might actual be trying to bring a true Final Fantasy game to mobile. That is until you read about the free-to-play part… Brave Exvius is a collaboration with the mobile developer behind the hit Brave Frontier. It looks much like Crystal of Time, but the systems and plot will probably feel different enough. It will also be free-to-play with microtransactions. Now the Portal App is part game, part rewards program and will tie-in to your Square Enix ID. It features the latest Final Fantasy news, swag, and aims to provide users the opportunity to earn points that can be exchanged for digital content. But the game element comes in the form of the Triple Triad card game from Final Fantasy 8. Which is one of the worst mini-games ever in the franchises history and I am so done talking about mobile games today. Oh and the Final Fantasy committee is high on Ether if they think this is the way to keep my loyalty. How about a new Tactics game? Please?!Speaking of begging for acknowledgment, Microsoft is giving Early Adopters of the Xbox One a few gifts to celebrate the year one anniversary. So on the 22nd you can log into Xbox Live for a free Year One gamer pic, background, background image, an exclusive Day One achievement background, plus free rentals of Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn & Dragon Ball Z: Battle of the Gods. The only catch is that you'll have to have purchased the console before November 11th, be at least 17 years old, and have logged 10 hours on your Xbox One. There is even a sweepstakes for a bunch of different prizes ranging from physical Call of Duty bundles, to digital content for a bunch first-party titles and a few third-party games as well. That's pretty cool, but will I be able to find my free stuff using Google Maps in the shitty UI?No idiot, you'll use Bing maps and never find it.And lastly, fans of Meta Knight won't be able to find his amiibo counterpart anywhere but at your local Best Buy. Scheduled to debut in 2015 according to the big box retailer, this is the second exclusive for the figurines. GameStop has the original exclusive with Shulk. I suspect Toys R Us and Amazon will be getting their own exclusives in time. But more than anything, Smash fans seem to be more upset with the exclusivity of MewTwo in the upcoming fighter. You see, you will only unlock him if you own both copies of Smash. Many have dug into the fine print on the upcoming fighter and whether or not you can purchase him outright. It appears Nintendo may offer him as a piece of paid DLC sometime in the future, but Sakurai told Videogamer.com something different. As far as he is concerned there is no plans for Smash DLC and MewTwo is an experiment for content distribution. Sakurai worries about backlash from the community for \"cutting up content to sell characters one by one”. So for now, the roster ends with MewTwo. This is contrary to some rumors we heard of potential Smash DLC in the future like Ice Climbers or the Rhythm Heaven's Chorus Men. If you had a choice, what DLC characters would you see added? Let us know in the comments.Today's comment comes from Corey Huffman who says \"I hate ps4 what do people have against Xbox one:(\" Hey buddy, real talk for a minute. I don't hate any of these consoles or publishers. In fact, I think my Xbox One has way better first party games than my PS4 right now. But when companies make dumb decisions, I am not afraid to call them out on it. So don't think we here at ScrewAttack hate Microsoft, Nintendo, or Sony. We just really like making fun of them.I'm Sean and THAT was Hard News.I loved that you watched this episode of Hard News, but you really need to get over to our Twitch for 24 hours of Super Smash Bros.

Ukranian StarCraft player Mihaylo Hayda tweeted \"Going to rape some girl soon #fragbitemasters” in the middle of a qualifying match. Specifically referencing his opponent, Madeleine Leander, who recounted her experience to the site eSport. She noticed something was up when a \"few minutes into the first map the game was paused.... because of the tweet.” Madeliene found it scary to see this sort of behavior coming from a pro player, but acknowledged the organization did what it could and ultimately disqualified Hayda from the tourney. Hayda later apologized for his behavior and took a hiatus from Twitter for a couple days noting he was \"really ashamed” and \"wanted to kill himself”. Based on that last tweet, it seems like he really learned something that day.On the other hand, people have yet to figure out that some crazy Kickstarter ideas, should stay crazy ideas. Blood Sport is a new technology being crowdfunded that incorporates the charitable act of donating blood and combine it with the fun of gaming. The tech uses an Arduino Board to make sure the blood is being sucked from your body and that you don't lose too much while playing. The issue here is that blood is drawn intravenously based on when the controller rumbles, so everytime you're shot, you'll lose a bit of blood. Now the crowdfunding campaign has just started and the team behind Blood Sport are looking for about 250,000 Canadian dollars, but have yet to clear $5K. You can head over to the kickstarter and toss your loonies in with the rest of ‘em, and help this group of secret vampire developers establish their new world order.Onto more crazy news, Raptr is trying to compete with MLG.TV and Twitch by opening their own streaming service, Plays.TV. It is currently in open beta and let's you share some of your best gaming moments with friends, using the social service. There is even some PC specific software that will allow you to capture your gameplay more easily. I think more competition for streaming platforms is great, but considering Twitch came integrated into both PS4 and Xbox One, the battle for supremacy is already over.And lastly, PSN was HACKED again! Along with some other stuff. Maybe. Kind of sort of? Or... not at all. You see, this past Friday a hacker collective known as DERP claimed they had stolen information from millions of users in Xbox Live, PSN,and even EA's Origin platform. They then posted on Twitter a few thousand of these usernames and information for public consumption. That content was very quickly taken down and the Twitter account went dark, but there hadn't been clarification on what actually happened. Sony has come forward after digging into the report and claims that no such intrusion has occurred. From their perspective, PlayStation takes \"these reports very seriously and will continue to monitor our [their] network closely.\" For now, it looks like this may have dodged a bullet, but stay vigilant g1s, hackers are everywhere. Isn't that right Feminist Hacker Barbie?!Our comment of the day comes from TouchyBanana who says \"why only 4 Hard News a week now? I thought there was one for each day except Saturday and Sunday Sean should be replaced with someone else?”. Fine. But it won't make you happy knowing there will only be three episodes this week, because it's Thanksgiving.

After the post-launch embargo of Unity left some owners feeling cheated by all the glitches and overall poor design choices, Ubisoft said they were \"working to adapt our services and communications with consumers accordingly”, in a show of good faith. In spite of this, Ubisoft has embargoed reviews for The Crew to be posted after the game launches next Tuesday. They claim this is due to the interconnected and open-world nature of the game, because \"The Crew was built from the beginning to be a living playground full of driving fans, so it's only possible to assess our game in its entirety with other real players in the world.\" So this brings up a very big question, has the nature of being first to market on any review site cost consumers the privilege of fair and unbiased reviews? Or is Ubisoft blowing smoke up our ass so they can make sure their first week of sales is the best it can be?One game that needs no review is the visual novel Hatoful Boyfriend. The pigeon dating simulation is like no other game in its genre. Hell, it's like no other game on the market right now and that's why after its PC release, we'll be seeing it on PS4 and Vita. In it you attend the St. PigeoNation's Institute as the last human female on earth, looking for an avian lover like no other. PlayStation has been embracing the bizarre indie scene for quite awhile now, so it only makes sense this game would release on PSN in the second quarter of 2015. It has quite a few bizarre paths that can lead to interspecies erotica or flat-out murder. If you'd like a taste of either, check out our live stream with Craig, Andre, and Playboy Playmate Irina Voronina; as they make their way through the game. Yup… That happened.In more new game news, Bandai Namco revealed that Darks Souls II is coming to ravage next-gen consoles, with a new title to boot. Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin will launch on April 7, 2015 for PS4, Xbox One, and PC's with DirectX 11. It's a re-release and will include all three pieces of DLC, along with enhanced graphics and an increased player count for multiplayer. This is also be coming to PS3, Xbox 360, and PC's with DIrectX 9, but won't include the improvements, just bundling the content together. All versions will be getting the bonuses from update 1.1 which includes new NPCs, expanded story, in-game events and better matchmaking. Seems like today is a great day for fans of the franchise. See you on PS4 this April g1s!And lastly, the reboot of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines as a fan project no longer has approval from copyright holder CCP. They've unfortunately put a stop the project's development, because well, they could, causing a years worth of work to hit the dustbin. Project Vaulderie was actually trying to reinvigorate the franchise by creating this update that would require you to own the game to play the fan remake, but still enjoy the great content on newer PCs. This is an especially strange situation, because Project Vaulderie had actually been trying to ensure this wouldn't happen by reaching out to the publisher Activision and getting a non-commercial license for the game. But while Activision had the rights to publish the game, CCP actually became the owner of all future Vampire Masquerade content when the acquired the book publisher White Wolf. So they're totally boned… Thanks CCP!Our comment of the day comes Oliver Martinelli who asks \"Did you know people in the UK don't celebrate thanksgiving?” Really? Why not? You managed to get rid of all those puritan douchebags and their belt buckle hats. That should totally be call for celebration.

The Crew Beta has arrived on PS4 and Xbox One, and it is open to everyone! So for the next few days you login to your PSN or Xbox Live and download the Beta for free. If you have Gold or PlayStation Plus subscription, your experience should be vastly improved with all the multiplayer options available. This is a great opportunity to skip the reviews altogether and just play the game before release to see if it's something you want. GG Ubisoft.    Hmm… It was kind of nice to compliment them once.    In other news, Sony has been found guilty of false advertising according to the Federal Trade Commission based on a series of ads that ran between late 2011 into early 2012. The ads touted a number of features on the PlayStation Vita, that consumers found misleading. That means anyone who purchased a Vita before June 1, 2012 is eligible for \"\"either a $25 cash or credit refund, or a $50 merchandise voucher for select video games, and/or services.\"\" The specific false claims seemed to mostly revolve around the Remote Play functionality and how the Vita communicates with the PS3. A feature that seems to work much better now that we have the PS4, so maybe Sony just was a little excited about the portable's potential. Either way, the functionality finally exists, but because Sony jumped the gun, we all get free shit! Now this isn't the first time Sony has lied to us, but it is the first time we've been paid for it.    With your new found fortune, you should consider checking out the Humble SEGA Bundle. It's a collection of some great SEGA games like NiGHTS Into Dreams, Sonic All-Stars, and the Dreamcast Collection. Throw in a couple more games and add-ons for the low low price of $3.50 and you have a nice little Steam bundle for the next few days. Oh and for the hardcore, you can pay $50 and get an exclusive t-shirt memorializing the dead console that is the Dreamcast.    And finally, on the subject of reviving the dead. Nintendo's foray into bringing back the Gamecube controller using the Wii U Adapter may have unlocked some secrets in the homebrew community. Michael Lelli is an engineer that experiments in modding and emulation as a hobby and might have figured out how to connect any controller to a Wii U. Michael purchased a $60 Linux board called a BeagleBone Black and through some clever reverse engineering of the Gamecube Adapter, determined the language used by peripheral connected to a Wii U. So now the BeagleBone can act as a bridge between ANY USB device and your Wii U. It still needs some programming before it can truly deliver on it's potential, but like Michael says, \"\"It would allow me to play Smash Bros. the way God intended; with a Steel Battalion controller.\"\"    Our comment of the day comes from Gigi Villalobos who asks \"\"Why aren't you doing any game reviews anymore? Are you slacking off?” Well Gigi, the process of reviewing a game is actually quite costly and time consuming. But we here at ScrewAttack still want to participate in talking about all the newest releases, so stay tuned for a new show coming in 2015. And why aren't you posting anymore bumper car videos?    I'm Sean and THAT was Hard News.    To celebrate the impending holiday, head over to ScrewAttack's YouTube and check out Nick's Day of Hell. It's filled with hazing, clowns, and a twisted tale of vengeance.

Still no price, but this is episode one of six, so it probably won't cost much at all. That means if you've been trying to catch up on the franchise, you'd better hurry, there are mere hours left before launch.Unfortunately for the remaining staff at the publication CVG, they might be out of time. One of Future publishings last and longest running gaming websites will be closing its doors according to MCV. Considered for closure in May, Computer and Video Games didn't fit into the massive conglomerate created on GamesRadar and was given six months to make itself worthy, but after 33-years it will be closing up shop. Future has yet to disclose as much officially, but the largest gaming website in the UK will be giving up the ghost and it will probably happen before the end of the year. Here's hoping the American, Australian, and UK staffers all land on their feet.Now we're going to dig even deeper into the International gaming news by turning our gaze to Russia, where some amiibo owners claim they can access the Moscow subway using the NFC powered figurines. You can see this Samus is at least making the gate consider opening. But some are saying it's an elaborate hoax, in spite of the evidence. Who's to say this won't ignite a political conflict with neighboring Japan? And I know Russia can be stubborn, but they don't have shit on Nintendo! I think Putin is going to have to bite the bullet on this one and make some subway changes, because these figurines are here to stay.While we're on that side of the world, China has already begun its adventure into console gaming with the recent launch of the Xbox One, but times are tough for Microsoft's poster child. The launch of Xbox in China has generally underperformed and it hasn't seen much support in the way of games. After a couple rumors though, it appears Tencent will be publishing a complete version of the Infinity Blade franchise to the Chinese market on Xbone. You can see from the leaked video that it will support Kinect and higher graphical fidelity to make the mobile game look all pretty on your widescreen TV. As a major stakeholder in Epic Games, it should come as no surprise that Infinity Blade will be coming to Xbox One in China, but will it make its way to the West? I'm sure we'll found out once there is an official release.And in more unofficial Chinese gaming news, PlayStation 4 might be trying to kick Microsoft while they're down. Rumors from media sites like Sina.com and PcGames.Com.cn point to the PlayStation platform entering the market at 2,999 RenMinBi, which is 1200 less than the Xbox One launch price, with a Kinect. That's $213 cheaper for PS4, even if you get a motion-controller with your Xbone. Going Kinect-less will save you a benjamin, but that still won't make up the additional $113 you'd be spending on the Microsoft platform over Sony. Rumors also point to the PlayStation 4 being officially announced for China this month, with Sony China and the Shanghai Media Group at the helm. Ironically, Shanghai Media Group also runs the Xbox distribution in China, so no matter what, the State-affiliated media company wins. Sorry Microsoft…Now we'd normally have our comment of the day, but it's time for real-talk. As some of you may have heard on a recent episode of Sidescrollers, Hard News will be coming to an end on December 19th. It was a tough decision, but ultimately it will free me up to make more great content for you guys and keep the well oiled machine running.

It will have you following a path of Reeses Pieces into a varmint snare, where he'll trap you and keep you in his private dungeon. To see what happens next you'll probably have to buy the DLC. And that \"\"defective” Samus figurine with dual arm cannons sold for a whopping $2500 on ebay. In other news, Nintendo says screw it and just begins to manufacture the rest of them that way. Onto the news!    Xbox Live was taken down by a DDoS attack last night. Users on Xbox 360 and Xbox One reported a \"\"80151909 error code — warning that an Xbox Live profile has failed to download”. Microsoft's support site didn't record there being an outage, but the Internet did and it seems to be coming from everyone's favorite reptilian hacker collective Lizard Squad, who took responsibility via Twitter. Attacks like these are becoming an all too common occurrence these days and Lizard Squad in the past claims to have used denial-of-service attacks against PSN, League, GTA Online, and even Destiny. BUT this time the hackers took it a step further, foreshadowing an even larger attack to come this Christmas holiday. That's the week of the Halo 5 BETA! Baby Jesus is gonna be pissed.    Maybe access to the Alpha test of the new game Fortnite will make him forget about his impending doom. Epic's latest IP is opening up sign-ups to the closed Alpha that kicks off today and runs through December 19th. It looks like the first wave of invites is out and since Fortnite is best played with buddies, it will let you bring two friends for the ride. The wave-based co-op shooter will have you building an epic fortress as you try to survive the most unholiest of nights. Interested in trying it first hand? Just follow the link in the description for the sign-up page. I wonder if Dom from Gears of War will make an appearance as an undead boss… SPOILERS!    Speaking of which, Barry Burton has been confirmed for the new Resident Evil: Revelations 2. His role in the franchise started at the beginning where he and the other S.T.A.R.S. members first encountered Umbrella's demented experiment. With this revelation of a new character comes the release date of February 17th for the first episode of the five episode series. What the deuce?! Yeah, apparently I missed the announcement that this sequel would be delivered episodically for $6 an episode. Following the launch on the 17th, expect one episode per week and you can bundle them up for $24.99 or snag a boxed copy for $39.99. Expect more Raid Mode DLC and levels as the game continues its post-launch support. Just don't expect too much from the franchise, we all saw what happened with RE6, Operation Raccoon City, and the entire movie franchise.    To follow up on our announcement yesterday, there were a handful of comments addressed at our new partners-in-crime Rooster Teeth being responsible for the departure of Hard News. They aren't. In fact, they probably aren't even aware of the decision. Yes, they run their own news channel called The Know and it's pretty good, but letting go of Hard News has been something we've struggled for quite sometime. So everyone be nice and don't worry, we have lots of exciting updates to ScrewAttack incoming.

Valve has decided that they can't let Twitch have all the fun when it comes to streaming games, so they're bringing the heat with Steam Broadcasting. The primary market seems focused on sharing live videos with friends, but it will have a public option for all of your fevered fans. You can watch the gameplay on Steam, Chrome, and Safari; but there are no archive options for the service at this time. I suspect that will change as the Beta evolves and to use the feature you'll have to opt-in to the Beta version of Steam. There doesn't seem to be any camera options either, maybe Valve just wants to keep the T&A to a minimum.Nintendo might be on the cusp of some major hardware issues with Wii U. Reddit has begun cataloguing a ton of instances where error code 160-0103 is bricking the hardware. Early reports were Smash was the culprit, but most seemed convinced that this isn't actually a software issue. User TVena suspects the error code is the result of a faulty or worn internal flash chip, most likely limited to a specific run off the factory line. It could be a firmware bug, but that would be even more random and unlikely. The point is Smash isn't responsible for the error code and you shouldn't be concerned playing your Wii U. It has enough problems of its own without us gamers feeling paranoid.In other news, Sony's PlayStation Experience is happening this weekend in Las Vegas and the manufacturer has announce a Limited Edition PlayStation 4 celebrating the 20th anniversary of the brand. And I want it so hard! Limited to a run of 12,300 units, this slick looking piece of hardware features the color scheme from the original PlayStation released back in 1994. It also comes packed with a sexy custom controller and camera, but there is no date or price. Expect more details to be revealed over the weekend. In the meantime, Sony uploaded a digital theme to PSN that harkens back to the original PlayStation era and you can download it on your PS4, PS3, and Vita RIGHT NOW. The PlayStation Blog in Europe is also reporting a sale on Classic titles, but keep an eye on the North American blog for a similar announcement. If you do happen to find yourself on PlayStation blog, be sure to check out \"Between Shu Ferns”. Yes, it's a shameless rip-off of the Zach Galifianakis show, but it has its moments and is a fun way to promote the PlayStation Experience.Of all the stories covered today, the biggest has to be the leak of the upcoming Assassin's Creed for 2015. Kotaku got their hands on a seven minute gameplay video, that was used most likely as an internal pitch for Assassin's Creed Victory. It is set to take place in Victorian London sometime around the 19th century. In the video Kotaku reports a variety of new gameplay options such as the ability to swap from the hood to a top hat while disguising yourself in a crowd, swinging on a grappling hook through the city, and the ability to engage in combat atop moving vehicles. But not play as a female assassin, because remember, that's too hard. After the leak went live, Ubisoft confirmed to many outlets that the assets are in fact from the upcoming game being developed by their Quebec studios. That means there is another new team creating an installment in the franchise, giving Montreal a year or two off to figure out where to take the franchise next. What else Assassin's Creed Victory has in store for us is anyone's guess, but since we're hitting up the Industrial Revolution, I look forward to murdering the shithead who wouldn't give Oliver Twist some more.Speaking of pissed, our comment of the day comes from Azero Tehiro who speculates on why Hard News is coming to an end and really nails it in my opinion. I have taken an excerpt from it, but I recommend reading the full thing. \"The new partner/competition shows that are now alongside Hard News simply made the heads of ScrewAttack think about their direction as a site in the interwebz. In the end, they decided that they shouldn't try to spread the jelly on the news side of the bread as well or else things would get too thin to really enjoy all the other parts of the game-toast. It's kind of understandable, considering all the latest news can be fetched via Twitter, Reddit etc. instantly nowadays via sites likes IGN, and Game Informer being are able to retrieve that press first-hand and sometime exclusively. ScrewAttack simply could not compete with that, as evident in how Hard News usually covered big video game news from the day before or even days prior. In exchange for Hard News, ScrewAttack's saving their new production show schedule for next year, January 2015, which will include Top 10s, Best Evers, Death Battle, Sidescrollers, random videos on the side, as well as 6 brand new shows.”Thanks Azero for wording that better than us and hopefully that will provide more clarification behind the decision and I'm gonna be in two of those new shows, so I'm not going anywhere.I'm Sean and THAT was Hard News.The latest episode of Sidescrollers is now live, so head on over to ScrewAttack.com and tune in for the weekly calamity that is our community focused podcast.

The developer Discord Games successfully completed a Kickstarter back in April of 2013 for Chasm, raising nearly $200,000 towards the indie title. This isn't the first Metroidvania title Adelman has helped, post his position at Nintendo, where he previously lent his expertise to Axiom Verge. Joking on his Blog, Adelman admits \"there are definite similarities in terms of the genre and overall framework. Tight controls. Challenging boss fights and a wide range of enemies.” Sounds like either project would be a home run for fans of platformers. Chasm is now expected to release on PS4, PC, Mac, and Linux for the second half of 2015. While other platforms are under consideration, there is no confirmation of a Wii U release for either of Dan's current projects. Sorry Nintendo.Other not so great Nintendo news comes way of the LA Times who reports that a paid actor is suing the gaming giant for his role in the Spring of 2013 release Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D. Parker Mills was hired by Nintendo to rock a Donkey Kong costume at a local zoo to help promote the game. According to his lawyer, \"Mills was denied breaks and not provided with the required ice pack to cool him down as he talked to zoo guests”. This created a \"stressful environment” for Mills, who suffered an aortic dissection that required heart surgery and a permanent defibrillator. The lawsuit also claims that the company provided ambassador to help Mills did not provide \"proper oversight”. Now his illness is unfortunate and temperatures might exceed 80 degrees around that time in LA, but let's be real honest here, Mills is just trying to milk that Nintendo teat before it dries up.And while we're talking boobies, YouPorn is the first company in the pornography business to sponsor an eSports gaming team. Hailing from Madrid, the Spanish eSports team Play2Win will now be known as Team YP in future competitions, including the upcoming Gamergy competition this weekend. There, Team YP will be competing in DOTA 2 to become the champions of the Internet. Brad Burns, VP of Porn at YouPorn had this to say about the partnership \"\"This partnership has been a long time coming, and I believe that with our backing, along with the expertise that each member of Team YP brings to the table on the virtual battlefield, we can succeed in tearing through the competition at this year's Gamergy event.” Well Brad, although everything you said is articulate and potentially accurate, it just sounds like more porn speak to me. And regardless of the outcome, this has to be the most relaxed eSports team in the world.Our comment of the day comes from Michael Platt who suggests \"I really want to see you both guys (Rooster Teeth and Screwattack) get into a vs series.... Maybe for charity?”. Well Michael, we used to have ScrewAttack Versus the Internet and it might just be coming back round in 2015. I would stay tuned for more announcements in the New Year, when we head down to SXSWi in the Spring.I'm Sean Hinz and THAT was Hard News!If you have a free moment why not check out Five Fun Facts for Super Mario Bros. 3, the greatest video game of all time.

Right now, Metal Slug 3 is launching on PS3, PS4 or Vita to will mark the 25th anniversary of the Neo Geo AES console and MVS arcade cabinets. New titles to vote on include King of Fighters, Fatal Fury, and Samurai Showdown. While they don't have Windjammers on the list, they do have Mark of the Wolves, so be sure to voice your opinion so we keep getting these great games!  Speaking of great games, Capcom may have just had their newest installment in the Street Fighter franchise leak for all of us to enjoy. Now most leaks come from some internal document or mole, but this one is all Capcom's fault, who posted the trailer on their YouTube and then promptly removed it. That didn't stop DailyMotion from keeping tabs on it though and what was probably going to be announced sometime over the next 72 hours, is now in the wild. Graphically it looks much like Street Fighter IV, but with more detailed character models who don't look quite as emotive. Ryu and Chun-li throw some kicks and punches between b-roll of FGC pros in what is almost a car commercial. Then the entire teaser ends with the explosive reveal of PS4 and PC platform exclusivity. I guess Sony looked at Microsoft's recent foray into the fighting game community with Killer Instinct and countered with the greatest fighting game franchise of all time. BOOM!  And this weekend is going to be a rife with new game announcements. Tonight Geoff Keighly will be holding the video game awards from Las Vegas, with Bryan and Craig are there as we speak. But the big news from the event won't be the winners, no the focus will be on the over 12 world premieres in-store for us. Including \"\"Bloodborne, Metal Gear Online, and the new King's Quest”. Additionally Sony is holding the PlayStation Experience the following 2 days and they have all kinds of stuff from No Man's Sky details, to whatever EMAGON is, and a mystery game or two. You can catch the Game Awards at 8 PM CST on every platform imaginable. We will be hosting the PlayStation Experience on our Twitch Channel and on the top of the site all weekend. You can find a complete schedule in the description.  Our comment of the day comes from toiletmunger who suggests, \"\"If the guy would have just waited a little bit so he could promote Tropical Freeze instead, Nintendo surely would have given him plenty of ice packs.?” Nailed it!

On top of the reveal of another Felyne customer from Devil May Cry, Capcom also announced two next-generation ports of the recently rebooted DmC and nearly the worst game in the franchise Devil May Cry 4. DmC Devil May Cry: Definitive Edition from Ninja Theory is everything from the previous generation all jammed onto one disc for $39.99. It features all the DLC, plus new modes, skins, and gameplay features for Xbox One and PS4. It will additionally boast the long sought after 1080p, 60 fps that the Internet is so enamored with these days. You can find this re-mastered version of DmC at retail or digital download on March 17th, of 2015. Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition will launch in the summer of 2015 and more details will be shared next year. Totally should have gone with Devil May Cry 3 guys. The style system was way more fun than that punk bitch Nero.More details have emerged about CD Projekt Red's newest protagonist in Witcher 3. Named Ciri, the character is referred to as a \"living weapon”, who is essential to the story. Pursued by the Wild Hunt, players will be passed control of her at key points throughout the game. Witcher 3 PR mastermind Robert Malinowski says Ciri \"has her own will and agenda, so it's not just finding her that counts. I think that is the most important aspect of this character. Geralt knows Ciri since she was a child. She's Geralt's apprentice and they have a close emotional bond”. Ahhh yesss, the old student/teacher emotional bond. I can't imagine why they aren't together anymore. Oh that's right, Geralt is smashing every chick in the kingdom.And finally Hatred and the terrifying subject matter it embodies won't be coming to Steam anytime soon. When the game launched its Greenlight campaign to have the game published on the world's most popular PC platform, Valve quickly took notice and decided to take matters into their own hands. Despite very quickly becoming the 7th most popular game on the service, Valve wanted us to know \"that based on what we see on Greenlight we would not publish Hatred on Steam. As such we'll be taking it down.” Destructive Creations responded by saying they respect \"Valve's decision” and his situation has inspired them to work harder to make the game we want. And while I myself enjoy some digital murder, this remains one of the most disturbing works of fiction I have ever laid eyes on. And I've seen Human Centipede 2.Our comment of the day comes from Jonathan Rodriguez who asks \"Shawn, who do u think is cuter, regular Chun-Li or kitty Chun-Li? ;)” Ummm… Wait a tick. Your avatar is a Pikachu… with a mustache. That Pikachu has a fancy mustache! Making him way cuter than kitty kat Chun-li. I'm going to give him a top hat and monocle! You're welcome.I'm Sean and THAT was Hard News.If you haven't heard yet, ScrewAttack Games' next title Disorder had a new gameplay trailer launch and you can check it out right now on our dot com. It teases some new elements we've never shown before and finally gives the game an official release date for PC and Mac on Steam.

Again! | Hard News 12/17/14","slug":"ultra-sf-iv-gets-wild-gabe-saves-hatred-ubisoft-bones-asscreed-again-hard-news-121714","number":0,"description":"I'm Sean Hinz and this is Hard News for Wednesday December 17th, 2014.Ultra Street Fighter IV had a \"wild \"update today, that has some of your favorite fighters embracing their more animal instincts. The DLC features new costumes, some of which are incredibly bizarre and others that give me a strange boner. Anyway... the selection is broken down in various packs, much like past costumed content and you can scoop them up individually for $4 a piece. Should you be a big spender, you can get all 44 costumes for $20. This DLC will be available following the version 1.04 patch featuring the wacky Omega Mode. Ugh the Sagat skin is awwwwfullll… Just like the price of this content.For the low low price of nothing, you can now download a patch that is supposed to make AssCreed Unity run as expected and fix \"most” outstanding issues. But there's an issue.. to make the frame rate more stable, Ubisoft had to rework a few sections of Paris and that means everyone needs to download a nearly 7 GB patch. As much as we may bitch an moan about this, that is becoming a pretty awful trend these days. That is until the Xbox One version somehow completely crapped out and now requires you to redownload the entire game at a whopping 40GB! Now that's something to complain about. Ubisoft says \"This is obviously not the expected behavior, and we apologize that many of you will have to wait longer than expected to complete this download.” But they don't have an ETA on a solution outside of this issue and are working with Microsoft to address this. Do you think Ubisoft has anymore DLC they can give away to make themselves feel better?Speaking of the big ‘M', it appears the project name for Microsoft's upcoming streaming service has leaked (thanks ZDnet), and they call it Arcadia. Using the Azure cloud, Microsoft hopes to offer its customers the ability to stream games and other content to Windows devices like say a Phone or low-end computer. When Polygon previously saw the ‘Rio' demonstration, Microsoft was able to stream Halo 4 to a Windows phone and connect a Xbox 360 controller. Assumably Arcadia would expand upon that and potentially offer up new features on Xbone, like backwards compatibility and some form of remote play. There was even an open discussion around streaming apps other than games, but that idea is not in the current timeline for Arcadia. Fun fact, Arcadia is the Unified Earth Gov colony from Halo Wars and the second instance a Microsoft product has been named after something in the Halo Universe. Just waiting on Phil Spencer to refer to himself as Master Chief and the exploitation of Bungie's masterpiece can reach an all time high.Lastly, it looks like Christmas miracles still happen because after hearing about Hatred being de-listed from Steam Greenlight, Santa Gabe stepped in and saved the day. In an open email to Destructive Creations, Gabe Newell had this to say about the situation. \"Yesterday I heard that we were taking Hatred down from Greenlight. Since I wasn't up to speed, I asked around internally to find out why we had done that. It turns out that it wasn't a good decision, and we'll be putting Hatred back up. My apologies to you and your team. Steam is about creating tools for content creators and customers.” Obviously the devs were thrilled and it looks like Steam fans were too, because in the 7 hours that followed the game skyrocketed to the number one spot on the service. Maybe they'll even get publisher approval for Hatred before the holidays. \"It's the most wonderful timeeee of the year.Our comment of the day comes from Jay Reyes \"Hey NEwsman, Get your facts straight and STOP ASSUMING SHIT. FOr FUcks SAke. ................... DMC 4 WAs AWEsome. DMC 5 is Good, but not that bad. GEt-YOur-Facts-STRAIGHT.” Hey Jay, my name is Sean. I say it at the start of EVERY episode and just so you know, those two comments on DmC are called opinions, just like my opinion that Devil May Cry 4 isn't MY favorite. Sorry if you don't agree that 3 is a better game, but that's why opinions are like assholes, everyone has one.I'm Sean and THAT was Hard News!I you're looking for something special for that special someone, how about the exclusive ScrewAttack hoodie for 2014?

The partnership aims to generate narrative-driven content for the franchise in traditional Telltale fashion, i.e. episodic content to be released on Xbox Live, PSN, PC, Mac, iOS, and Android devices. They will do their best to keep the game as \"Minecrafty” as possible, even going as far as to make this announcement using an interactive press release called Info Quest II and teasing the launch of Minecraft 2. Just FYI, there is no Minecraft 2. Anyhoo, Mojang clarifies that they're \"not intending on creating an \"official” story for Steve, or explaining the world of Minecraft in detail. It will be a cool game.” This looks to be the first major initiative at Mojang since Microsoft purchased them and the Minecraft franchise earlier this year. Commence the hating Debbie downers!But don't you dare hate on the latest Steam controller leak. What was previously a boombox for your hands is quickly morphing into a more \"traditional” gamepad. The latest leak points to the addition of a d-pad in the left haptic area and if you'd forgotten, a set of face buttons has already been replaced by an analog stick. While this certainly isn't a finalized retail build, it does point to the notion that the controller, much like Steam Machines, will be customizable. So if you don't like rubbing those areolas on your Steam Controller to play Street Fighter V, then it looks like you can slap a pastie on dem titties. Mmmm… Boob controller.In OTHER news, Evolve has revealed the third monster coming to the hunt in 2015. Known as the Wraith, the monster seems incredibly fast and even more deceptive than its brethren. A trailer released by 2K shows its incredible speed and ability to spawn a decoy, opening up the team of hunters to be flanked. Like Kraken, it looks to be a flying type with massive scythes on his shoulders. Turtle Rock continued this information dump by teasing an open beta for Xbox One starting on January 15th and 48 hours later they'll add in the recently revealed Evacuation mode. All progress made in the open beta will carry over to the game when it launches in February and it will feature a dozen maps, eight hunters, and two monsters. Closed betas will arrive on the 16th for PC and 17th for PS4. When the game launches in February, it will support an offline mode and 2K even released a cheeky demonstration video. Too bad they forgot that Microsoft needs to verify you own the game EVERY. 24. HOURS.Finally, Suny Picturezzz is decided to like not not cancel dat crazy mofo ass premiere of an Interview picture with moving pictures because of that supreme leader of North Korea. My lord. And. Savrior. Kum Jang-in threatened. A local movieplex with an nuclear donkey punch. wait. what? a nuclear pigeon doo doo. stare blankly at camera. noap….

DAYAM Jeana! 4four fat billz is sum seriouz. CASH HOMY. *look at sean* but the Internetz think Sanie sux anywhyz. Sumthang about dat 1first amindment rites & free-speach and terrorists…Ahhh screw this… I know my bit is someone else writes and I go in blind but calm your shit, people. Sony's canceling The Interview after a terrorist threat on theaters, possibly from North Korea. They're sacrificing millions of dollars to protect lives on Christmas of all days. Sure, this sucks, the movie looks fun. But with all the other crap Sony's been through lately, it'd be careless to just laugh this off. Does this mean the terrorists win? . . . it's a freakin' movie, people. Let's fight our battles where they really count. The situation is too complex to set a precedent for repeat, anyway. Soooo Christmas is saved, and keep an eye out for The Interview's red carpet premiere on every torrent site.Our comment of the day comes from Seamelody who asks \"Did you know that what gave you a strange boner was actually a dude?” WHAT?! But as I explained in our Worst Ever Sexy Chicks, Capcom confirmed that Poison was a girl again. I just don't know what to believe anymore… oh and for the record, you'd be surprised at what give Sean a strange boner.And finally, with Hard News coming to an end I wanted to personally thank you, our wonderful audience, for watching this crazy show for the last almost 7 years. When we launched Hard News back in 2008, it was the very first daily gaming news show online and man, has it been an adventure to see the show evolve over the years. We take great pride in that Hard News was the first. ScrewAttack has always been an innovator in the world of online video, daring to try new things before that thing was even a thing. So with that said, we're going to be taking that same maverick attitude and putting it into several other new shows for your enjoyment starting in January. Give them a watch and maybe, just maybe you'll be able to enjoy them as much as you have enjoyed Hard News. Thanks to Destin, Corey, Jared, Chad, Sean, Ben, Nick, Sam and everyone else who sat behind the Hard News desk. You've helped make Hard News and ScrewAttack what it is today.","length":436,"original_air_date":"2014-12-18T15:34:00.000Z","channel_id":"92b6bb21-91d2-4b1b-bf95-3268fa0d9939","channel_slug":"rooster-teeth","season_id":"ffa2901d-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","season_slug":"hard-news-season-1","season_number":1,"show_title":"Hard News","show_id":"ff932b21-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","show_slug":"hard-news","is_sponsors_only":false},"uuid":"00165637-464e-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","archive":{"id":"roosterteeth-7048","status":"archived","files":[{"name":"2014-12-18_Steam_Controller_Update_New_Evolve_Monster_Sony_Cancels_The_Interview__Hard_News_121814_[7048].description","filesize":5282,"file_ext":"description","md5":"7ba6661480becb7e94f077a893bc030d"},{"name":"2014-12-18_Steam_Controller_Update_New_Evolve_Monster_Sony_Cancels_The_Interview__Hard_News_121814_[7048].info.json","filesize":25325,"file_ext":"json","md5":"f84445b1fb6db70ca2c9ecbd44cb9e43"},{"name":"2014-12-18_Steam_Controller_Update_New_Evolve_Monster_Sony_Cancels_The_Interview__Hard_News_121814_[7048].jpg","filesize":136457,"file_ext":"jpg","md5":"746245bec8c5769361c9fadffe42b300"},{"name":"2014-12-18_Steam_Controller_Update_New_Evolve_Monster_Sony_Cancels_The_Interview__Hard_News_121814_[7048].mp4","filesize":229488713,"file_ext":"mp4","md5":"273d749b63c629df120da064e59a577d"}]}},{"id":7049,"type":"episode","attributes":{"title":"The Final Episode | Hard News 12/19/14","slug":"the-final-episode-hard-news-121914","number":0,"description":"I'm Sean Hinz and this is Hard News for Friday December 19th, 2014.Despite all the good will Santa Gabe has been pumping into the Holiday pipeline, it looks like Valve will be taking a little back this season. For as long as I could remember, Steam was always a region-free platform meaning you could by games in one country and gift them to a friend in another. That feature was also exploited by users in countries, who for various reasons, found their copies of Steam games to be much cheaper than most. Now due to Russia being on the brink of a recession as the Ruble's value plummets, Valve has decided to rectify this age old issue of price-dodging by no longer allowing you to gift Steam games across regions. So anyone hoping that the collapse of the Russian economy would some how help them get cheap games is shit out of luck. While I don't blame Valve for being proactive, this also means that any friendos you have overseas that you planned to buy Steam games for the holiday, just had their gifts tied up in digital customs. Santa Gabe help us, you're our only hope!If you're looking for some new and cheap games this holiday, there were quite a few reveals yesterday. Halo 5: Guardians multiplayer beta is arriving for most Xbone owners on the 29th, but if you're in the Preview Program it is live today. You'll have all weekend to get ahead of your buddies before the new year. Nintendo revealed that Duck Hunt would arrive on the eShop Christmas day, so dust off that Wiiimote and show that dog what you're made of. Halfbrick is so excited about the holiday season, that you can scoop up their entire catalog on iOS for free. I've always felt they made some of the best mobile games around, so consider picking up Jetpack Joyride, Fish Out of Water!, and Colossatron ASAP. Oh and Fruit Ninja, but I figure everyone owns that by now. And there's just one more game, starring Devolver Digital's CFO Fork Parker that launched yesterday. He is going to try and cut you a deal in Fork Parker's Holiday Profit Hike, a vertical sidescroller a la Ice Climbers, released on Steam for free. It's short, but has a high-replay value. Merry Christmas!Finally, If you haven't heard, that guy who created Minecraft is stinking rich. I mean, Notch is like \"I just bought a mansion in Beverly Hills for $70 million” rich. Why is this newsworthy? Well he set a record for the most expensive property purchase in an area known for expensive property and he did so with a winning bid, beating out music tycoons Jay-Z and Beyonce. BOOM! VIDEO. GAMES. A quick tour of the property shows just how rich he is, like the panoramic glass wall overlooking downtown LA and Notch's new infinity pool. Or how about the many specialized rooms like a wine cellar, movie theater, candy room and vodka bar. Oh and let's not forget it is fully furnished with Bentley pillows, a replica James Dean motorcycle and a light machine gun dipped in chrome. I can't help but feel like I should have gone into game development…Our comment of the day comes from many of you in the g1Nation looking for direction now that the show has ended. Before you go some other channel, here's my two cents. I came to ScrewAttack in 2011 to help build a larger news presence on the dot com. While we we're quite successful for awhile, we came to the realization that news was a tough racket. So as times changed we began to focus more and more on videos. I helped bring SGC back, becoming the company wide event planner, and even had my own show called Nerdtastic. At least for a little while. When I took over Hard News last November, it was only to be a temporary solution, but in the past year I've shot over 250 episodes and accumulated around 8.5 million views. That will forever be one of the highlights of my career in games and I cannot thank you enough for your love and support. To be clear, I'm NOT leaving ScrewAttack, just taking on a larger business roll behind the scenes. If you want to continue supporting me, follow my Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Vine; subscribe to me on YouTube, where in 2015 I might be doing some news stuff on my own time; and as always you can find me on ScrewAttack where I am hosting a new podcast next year, appearing in shows like Best Ever, Is it Good?, and other random awesome videos. Oh and don't worry, SGC 2015 will be bigger and more badass than ever. Until then I hope you have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!I'm Sean and THAT was Hard News!","length":307,"original_air_date":"2014-12-19T13:30:00.000Z","channel_id":"92b6bb21-91d2-4b1b-bf95-3268fa0d9939","channel_slug":"rooster-teeth","season_id":"ffa2901d-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","season_slug":"hard-news-season-1","season_number":1,"show_title":"Hard News","show_id":"ff932b21-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","show_slug":"hard-news","is_sponsors_only":false},"uuid":"0016508d-464e-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","archive":{"id":"roosterteeth-7049","status":"archived","files":[{"name":"2014-12-19_The_Final_Episode__Hard_News_121914_[7049].description","filesize":4463,"file_ext":"description","md5":"8efc5a111ea7449db2d83548af779eab"},{"name":"2014-12-19_The_Final_Episode__Hard_News_121914_[7049].info.json","filesize":24195,"file_ext":"json","md5":"2e79601d13744606c2449589c6822332"},{"name":"2014-12-19_The_Final_Episode__Hard_News_121914_[7049].jpg","filesize":164195,"file_ext":"jpg","md5":"e12be15b4cfce55b08b45b4a7ccf7b56"},{"name":"2014-12-19_The_Final_Episode__Hard_News_121914_[7049].mp4","filesize":160876762,"file_ext":"mp4","md5":"06e1f96d0e26b9142a75c3aae6454eed"}]}},{"id":6250,"type":"episode","attributes":{"title":"Hard News 08/29/11","slug":"hard-news-082911","number":4,"description":"Today on Hard News Gears of War 3 is ready for the season, Skyward Sword is coming with a soundtrack, and will Mickey be epic again?\r\nGears of War 3 Season Pass -
