Today, I wanted to talk to you all about something that is a extremely important to all of us here at Funhaus. And that something, is Comedy. The big \"\"C,\"\" as I call it.    As you watch this GTA gameplay, you'll notice that the episode begins with what we call a \"\"bit.\"\" Now, until this point in time -- knowing what we know of Funhaus, their weekly GTA sessions, and Bruce's aptitude for the game -- we can make an informed statement and say that Bruce isn't exactly the best GTA player in the world. However, Bruce has a major trump card; he has been playing GTA nightly, in secret, and in doing so his skill with the game has improved exponentially, propelling him to an elite, pro status. During his prideful boasting, he claims to have clocked an approximate 500 hours of playtime over two years. He is so confident in his GTA prowess that he approaches the match with a smug, self-assertiveness that gives him the air of a pompous mouth-a-bout.    When Bruce begins to play, we see the illusion crack. Clearly Bruce is not the seasoned player he originally purported to be. The sad truth is that Bruce was lying and did not play GTA for as many hours as he claimed. His skill is laughable, he barely knows the controls, and quite frankly, he's just plain bad. As he continues to play he must hold fervently and defensively to his original proclamations, although it's obvious that he is losing grip on the charade, making it all the more pathetic and humorous.    This is where the comedy happens. By establishing expectations beforehand and then essentially flipping them, Bruce shocks and dismays us, the audience, belittling himself and playing the apt fool. Good, easy comedy often comes about when you tell your audience one thing, and then surprise and awe in an unexpected way. It might not be Comedy 101, but it's definitely up there -- Comedy 103, or 104, maybe.     Writing a YouTube explanation breaking down a joke is at least Comedy 307.","length":596,"original_air_date":"2016-04-13T15:00:00.000Z","channel_id":"2dc2a30b-55b7-443c-b565-1b3be9257fc4","channel_slug":"funhaus","season_id":"b862190c-0130-432f-956a-e3ca83f2d867","season_slug":"funhaus-plays-gta-5-2016","season_number":2,"show_title":"Funhaus Plays GTA 5","show_id":"391cf335-876e-431e-8397-62c6f5942267","show_slug":"funhaus-plays-gta-5","is_sponsors_only":false},"uuid":"0034e07a-464e-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","archive":{"id":"roosterteeth-10967","status":"archived","files":[{"name":"2016-04-13_WORLD_OF_TANKS_-_GTA_5_Gameplay_[10967].description","filesize":1980,"file_ext":"description","md5":"284325d843798186106e27d3a2b7ae29"},{"name":"2016-04-13_WORLD_OF_TANKS_-_GTA_5_Gameplay_[10967].info.json","filesize":21755,"file_ext":"json","md5":"a62e1e6ce2973dac3f093b543e2290e6"},{"name":"2016-04-13_WORLD_OF_TANKS_-_GTA_5_Gameplay_[10967].jpg","filesize":135636,"file_ext":"jpg","md5":"6eb778551e13eed95b2985601bb11d90"},{"name":"2016-04-13_WORLD_OF_TANKS_-_GTA_5_Gameplay_[10967].mp4","filesize":312583368,"file_ext":"mp4","md5":"2b264af0c10d3047a1407e715cae8b84"}]}},{"id":10965,"type":"episode","attributes":{"title":"HUGE F*CK UPS - GTA 5 Heists Gameplay, Series A Funding Part 2","slug":"gameplay-2016-huge-f-ck-ups-gta-5-heists-gameplay-series-a-funding-part-2","number":23,"description":"Funhaus Trivia: Our last GTA 5 heist went up one year TO THE DAY.
