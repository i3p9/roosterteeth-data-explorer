Unlike the others, he has not been lost, no! In order to maintain his essence, he was fused with the finest flowers and sealed away in these here magic seeds. They say when the world needs Jeremy most, a gullible young boy (or girl) must buy these magic seeds and plant them. In 6-8 months, Jeremy the Short will be reborn as Plant Jeremy the Flower King - a most brave hero with flowers filling his mouth! So hopefully grave terror is far enough away to where you have time to plant the Jeremy plant before our world is doomed.By the look on your face, you don't seemed convinced. Well fuck you too, kid.
