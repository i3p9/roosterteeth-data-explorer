She caught Joel's shingles. Shingles are typically comparatively mild in humans, but the virus is very aggressive for Glittercorns - Flitter's grandmother Yiskabelle came down with a case a few years ago and it wasn't pretty. They attacked her Sparkle glands and, unable to produce the vital Glittercorn MagicSheen that keeps their kidneys working, Yiskabelle suffered total organ failure.Anyway, Flitter is in intensive care now. We're hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst. Please do us a favor and leave a #PrayForFlitter on the video, and on twitter - she'll really appreciate the love even though the pain has forced us to put her in a medically induced coma.Remember: #PrayForFlitter.

Nintendo rarely does well for us, so this is kind of an experiment. Maybe you'll watch it. Maybe you won't. But maaaaayybe you will.....See, the key to doing a solid episode of Dude Soup is to have something crazy or controversial. We've been lucky this year, in that we keep stepping in all kinds of gaming shit: Silent Hills, or Fallout 3, or that time Bruce said did thing that got us sued only we can't talk about it anymore and had to delete the episode due to an out-of-court settlement with that one kid's family.Regardless, there's none of that this week. Doesn't mean the episode isn't good, just that I'm personally a little worried that it won't do well. So please, do me a favor: tell your friends to watch Dude Soup. Download it. Listen to it twice!!
