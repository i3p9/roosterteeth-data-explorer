The issue of their marriage was two children: Gris the Elder Brother and Kris, a younger son given to spending his inheritance. His family disowned their wayward son, who was forced to become a privateer in order to make his way. During a brief stay in the West Indies, Kaptain Kris fell in love with Cinnamon, a prostitute in her waning years of fertility.

Kill the Spoole-man!' Shouted people on their assesAnd it's likely they'd have killed him had not Larwence raised his glasses.With a smile of Texan charity great Larry's visage shone;He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;He signaled to the server, his hands on the game pad;But Lawrence still ignored it and Spoole exclaimed, \"You're bad!'\"Fuck you!' cried Bruce and Adam and the echo cried, \"Fuck you!\"But one scornful look from Lawrence and then everybody knew.The first two tries were warmups, he was ready now at lastAnd they knew that Lawrence wouldn't let the next chance pass.The sneer is gone from Larry's lip, his temper is bipolar,He pounds with cruel violence his thumbs on the controller;And now the game reloads the match, and now he's loaded in,And now the air is shattered by the force of Larry's chin.Oh, somewhere in this favoured land the sun is shining bright,The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light;And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout,But there is no joy in Funhaus 'mighty Lawrence has wiped out.","length":422,"original_air_date":"2015-05-05T20:00:20.000Z","channel_id":"2dc2a30b-55b7-443c-b565-1b3be9257fc4","channel_slug":"funhaus","season_id":"ffa186ec-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","season_slug":"funhaus-gameplay-season-1","season_number":1,"show_title":"Gameplay","show_id":"ff92da42-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","show_slug":"gameplay","is_sponsors_only":false},"uuid":"fffe13ea-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","archive":{"id":"roosterteeth-11134","status":"archived","files":[{"name":"2015-05-05_BATMEN_VS_BATWOMEN_[11134].description","filesize":3127,"file_ext":"description","md5":"4c74db8c7ed1c8974ef0624aa1df973c"},{"name":"2015-05-05_BATMEN_VS_BATWOMEN_[11134].info.json","filesize":22730,"file_ext":"json","md5":"ee53e0aabaf2c17379bacee78d5c8cfa"},{"name":"2015-05-05_BATMEN_VS_BATWOMEN_[11134].jpg","filesize":98354,"file_ext":"jpg","md5":"1ddc6c456cd6ccd201d956da86b097c0"},{"name":"2015-05-05_BATMEN_VS_BATWOMEN_[11134].mp4","filesize":220527939,"file_ext":"mp4","md5":"d17894aa5cc9fe5a9331025dfcbc0dbb"}]}},{"id":11133,"type":"episode","attributes":{"title":"KING F*CK UP","slug":"funhaus-gameplay-season-1-king-f-ck-up","number":38,"description":"Coronation Ceremony: The Archbishop of The Greater Island: \"Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the Peoples of the Kingdom of The Greater Island and Lesser Islands, Canada, The Forestrealm, the Union of Rocks and Dirt,and Ceylon, and of your Possessions and other Territories to any of them belonging or pertaining, according to their respective laws and customs\"Kate Winslet: \"I solemnly promise so to do.\"The Archbishop of The Greater Island: \"Will you to your power cause beach sleepers to be executed, in Mercy, in all your judgments\"Kate Winslet: \"I will.\"The Archbishop of The Greater Island: \"Will you to the utmost of your power maintain the Laws of Bruce and the true profession of Chopper Will you to the utmost of your power maintain in the Greater Island the Platforming Stair Mario Challange, established by law Will you maintain and preserve inviolable the settlement of the House of Logs and Vines, and the doctrine, worship, discipline, and government thereof, as by law established in The Greater Island And will you preserve unto the other Players on this Server and the Beaches and Huts there committed to their charge, all such rights and privileges, as by law do or shall appertain to them or any of them\"Kate Winslet: \"All this I promise to do.

He scrambled left -- the Guards moved to chase him, but tumbled and rolled beneath their legs and darted into the streets. The Captain sounded a horn, again and again; troops tumbled out of tents and wagons and tried to see the cause of this disturbance. The orderly lines of the camp erupted in chaos.    The Boy was in a panic. He didnt know where to go, so he just kept running. He crashed against a rack of pikes and bounced into a man saddling a horse. The horse jumped back into a brazier, scalding his flank - he kicked out and sent hot coals flying onto a canvas tent, which immediately caught fire. The horse ran scared as the fire leapt from tent to tent.    The blackpowder! Someone screamed, and any remaining attention on The Boy was forgotten in a mad rush to the waterbuckets.     The Boy pushed his way through the crowd and found a dark alley between stacks of barrels, watching the madness. He frantically searched for an exit from Fort Hornwick, but the palisades remained standing: there was no way out.    In a few minutes, the Captain had organized a brigade of waterbuckets; most of the fire was contained. The Boy realized his chance was almost up, and he made a decision: he ran, searching for a place to hide. As he tore down a line of tents, a line of soldiers marched past.    Out of the way, page! one of the yelled, and shoved him, hard. The Boy reeled backward, falling tail-over-ankles into a tent. He shook his head to catch his bearings, and looked up.

The First Vaulters didn't have much: a small living quarters with a couple of cots, a fairly inefficient generator, some water and food. But what they had was moxie. Yes, moxie: that hard-to-define quality that keeps a pep in your step, and gives a goose to your Bruce! With nothing but spit, elbow grease, and a couple of reclaimed BB guns, these First Vaulters dug deep into the mountain, fucked themselves silly to create families, and built an entire underground society. Every few hours, one of them would venture out to the Wastelands, but they all knew that the only safe place was in Vault 542, under the watchful, protective eye of the Overseer.Their crowning achievement was building a statue to their Overseer. They began to bring him offerings of food, Nuka-Cola, and nubile young females. And the Overseer was pleased. Very pleased. He turned Vault 542 into a pleasure palace, filled with games parlors and bars.Everyone wanted to come to Vault 542. The Overseer was a god unto them.

It's just a fun ride, it's a name! Like, when you go into a Bounce Castle, it's not an actual castle. A Bounce King doesn't reign supreme there as the monarch of a tiny kingdom. The Pirate Ship isn't manned by 18th Century scurvy-ridden terrors of the seven seas!So don't even worry about it. Sure, it's soundproof, and you have a sign a waiver releasing the State Fair of all liability. I guess you have a point there. But come on, it'll be FUN! You LOVED the Orbiter, and it's not like we went to space!Look: I absolutely, positively guarantee that you will not die in the Tunnel of Death. Probably.","length":493,"original_air_date":"2015-07-16T13:57:41.000Z","channel_id":"2dc2a30b-55b7-443c-b565-1b3be9257fc4","channel_slug":"funhaus","season_id":"ffa186ec-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","season_slug":"funhaus-gameplay-season-1","season_number":1,"show_title":"Gameplay","show_id":"ff92da42-464d-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","show_slug":"gameplay","is_sponsors_only":false},"uuid":"0005495a-464e-11e7-a302-065410f210c4","archive":{"id":"roosterteeth-11096","status":"archived","files":[{"name":"2015-07-16_TUNNEL_OF_DEATH_[11096].description","filesize":947,"file_ext":"description","md5":"5185c415d344f2f9786e66907af7b748"},{"name":"2015-07-16_TUNNEL_OF_DEATH_[11096].info.json","filesize":20511,"file_ext":"json","md5":"9aaf225263789cc33e012406a742e106"},{"name":"2015-07-16_TUNNEL_OF_DEATH_[11096].jpg","filesize":145812,"file_ext":"jpg","md5":"79f5b787ca502c10f6d8bec3c6793b08"},{"name":"2015-07-16_TUNNEL_OF_DEATH_[11096].mp4","filesize":259784169,"file_ext":"mp4","md5":"27c4a41a9a31da0965457b0b727b77c0"}]}},{"id":42371,"type":"episode","attributes":{"title":"HOT CHICKS & UGLY DUDES","slug":"funhaus-gameplay-season-1-hot-chicks-and-ugly-dudes","number":74,"description":"Papa Joel is on vacation for about 7 weeks, so guess who's writing descriptions!

He quickly untied the rope from the dock post and jumped in. As the boat drifted away from the dock, he grabbed the oars and pushed away, catching the current, moving downriver. The Boy dipped the oars into the water...and realized he'd never been in a boat before, let alone navigated one. He hesitated --    Let me guess. No naval experience The Courtesan asked wryly.     The Boy shrugged.    Ok, move it. He gave up his position as she moved into the center bench, deftly handling the oars and easing the boat into the center of the river. Fort Hornwick rapidly fell away, the sounds of chaos and smells of smoke receding into the distance. The Cortesan fell into an easy pulse with the boat, letting the current do most of the work.    Where did you learn to rescue damsels in distress I need to have a word with your teachers.    Hey, at least were out of the camp, I guess. And just because I cant...boat...well, I bet you dont know how to wrestle the eggs from a Skycat or find a vein of Truegold in a dark cave!    The Courtesan laughed. Fair enough. We all have our hidden skills. If youre lucky, you may even discover more of mine.    The Boy turned red as a bloodberry. An awkward silence hung over the boat, punctuated by the rhythmic squeaking of the rusty oars, the splashing water on the boat.    My apologies - my sisters always told me I was too forward.    With boys    With boys, with men, with anything. My philosophy is, why let everyone else have all the fun    The boy pondered that a moment. Fun wasnt much valued on The Mountain he called home. It was a hardscrabble existence, a constant fight for survival against the Beasts of the Wild, the Storms of the Great Sky, and the Mountain itself. I think I should very much like to have fun as well.    And so we shall! Lets see - weve got some food and supplies in the boat. Enough for at least a couple of weeks, Id guess. Were dressed as common peasants, but looky here!    She raised a soldiers uniform out of a sack in the boat.    And were riding on Gilderfern Brook. Gilderfern flows through these hills, into Knifewater Canyon. Bandits there, but the water flows swiftly and we could be in and out like a buttered trout...as they say. From there, it joins with the Mighty Rashorne River and wends to Rashgate Capital and the Great Water.    Of course, thats only if we decide not to stop at The University on the way. Lots to see there, of course, and much to learn.

The previous few days had been...interesting. The days saw them negotiating rapids, storms, a small pack of wolves. A run-in with the bandits had left him with a scar on his forehead and a hole to plug in the boat -- but also a small sack of silver pennies, a dagger for him, and a bow and quiver of arrows for her.     The nights saw him building a fire and studiously avoiding staring at The Courtesan as she bathed and taught him songs from her childhood. By the end of the journey, his back was knotted and sore, and the callouses on his hands had callouses, but he felt good. Hed learned more in this week than any time since hed left The Mountain, and his decision to visit The University meant hed soon learn even more.     They tied off the boat at a small dock and sold it to the Wharfmaster. the sack of pennies grew heavier. The Courtesan desired a bath and a change of clothes, so he left her at The Inn of the Halfmoon Sisters. The sack of pennies grew lighter. The Boy then promptly marched over to the Bursars Office and enrolled both of them. The sack of pennies grew lighter, still.    He spent the next few days learning about The University: its courses of study and Magisters, its buildings and courtyards, its Colleges and Pomp Houses. The University had a complex system of Colleges and Pomp Houses: The Colleges were specialized enclaves where like-minded scholars could gather and discuss their researches. The Pomp Houses, though were more like brotherhoods, or clubs: residences and dining halls for friends and compatriots.     Some Pomp Houses, or Pomps, had lineages of hundreds of years, with traditions and rites, with special food and drinks and colors and symbols associated with them. There were Pomps for scions of noble families, mansions and halls large enough for a country estate, and there were Pomps that were little better than glorified boarding houses for destitute students. They existed side by side, in rivalry with each other, constantly battling for status and prestige.     The Pomps threw lavish parties at the beginning of Crossterms in order to attract new members, and The Boy attended many of them.     He brought The Courtesan to Kestorhouse, one of the oldest and most distinguished Pomps. She charmed the members with banter and gossip of Eastern Noblemen; after dinner they invited them both to join.    He brought The Courtesan to dance and dine at Pepperpots, a middling Pomp renowned for long nights of music and extravagant feasts. Her graceful footing and appreciation for food won them an invite to join.    He brought The Courtesan to drink at The Empty Flagon, a lower-class Pomp more known for troublemaking and disturbing the peace than for studying.
